Capturing value in the new agri-food domain of growth
By 2050, the world’s population will exceed nine billion. Providing healthy food for everyone while conserving land, water and energy is a daunting challenge. To meet it, fresh ideas and new collaborations are emerging, spanning the traditional boundaries of agriculture, technology and food value chains. Industries are reconfiguring. Production and distribution systems are being reshaped to focus on the essential goal of feeding the world. The result is a newdomain of growth, full of opportunities for new business models—we can help you seize them.

Consumers are demanding healthier, more sustainable food––driving the need for greater transparency. We need to know how food is produced, where it comes from and its environmental impact.
Meeting these expectations requires collaboration. Companies, regulators and stakeholders must work together to deliver better nutrition, sustainable consumption and global food security.
One third of the world’s food is wasted. From farm to store, the food value chain is inefficient and outdated. Climate change and geopolitics are adding risk. Building resilience is crucial.
There’s good news—solutions are within reach. New technologies are revolutionising how we produce, store and distribute food. And there’s significant room in food supply chains for sustainability wins and cost improvement.
By reducing waste, increasing transparency and making data-driven choices, we can transform agri-food supply chains.
It’s possible to meet rising food demand, support biodiversity and achieve net zero without harming the planet. But to do this, food production must become smarter and more sustainable.
Collaboration is critical—farmers, producers, retailers and governments working together to make it happen. Adopting innovative technologies, sustainable farming methods and forward-thinking business models.
As players across the food domain become more connected, advanced tech is solving the toughest problems and creating opportunities.
Satellites and drones are boosting productivity and conserving resources. Blockchain and the internet of things (IoT) are ensuring food traceability and safety. AI and precision fermentation are making production smarter and greener.
Across the world, the potential of tech-enabled, data-driven agriculture to increase yields, decrease costs and improve sustainability is enormous.
Our food system needs to work with, not against, nature. This means a reimagined domain that values natural resources accurately using both financial and non-financial metrics.
We’re working closely with agri-food businesses, consumer product companies, governments and other stakeholders. Together, we’re creating frameworks that will value and protect our natural assets.
A reconfiguration of the global economy means the value of the Feed domain could reach up to US$10.8 trillion in 2035. We’ve mapped the value in motion from now to 2035, so you can build a future-ready business to capture it.
See the shifts. Seize the value. Stay ahead.

Industries are reshaping around fundamental human needs, creating value through collaboration across interconnected domains that now replace traditional value chains.

As eMobility accelerates, a robust and accessible charging infrastructure will be critical to stimulate adoption and meet demand. The market is ripe for disruption—presenting opportunities for growth and value creation.
Adoption of EVs will have a profound impact on the automotive supply chain—from mining raw materials to after-sales maintenance. To thrive in this new mobility domain, you’ll need to be agile.
Smart mobility is harnessing data and technology to make transportation safer, more affordable and inclusive. People will have better transport experiences and greater choice. But it will take innovative, cross-sector collaboration and powerful public–private partnerships to make this real.
Tomorrow’s resilient, sustainable transport systems are bringing together innovative technologies such as AI, internet of things (IoT), sensors and data analytics. This is smart mobility tech—driving innovation and providing exciting opportunities for growth, and for changing the way we move.
A reconfiguration of the global economy means the value of the Move domain could reach up to US$6.4 trillion in 2035. We’ve mapped the value in motion from now to 2035, so you can build a future-ready business to capture it.See the shifts. Seize the value. Stay ahead.

Bright Food — enhancing trust and transparency through global risk and regulatory platform transform
Industry
Food and beverage
Our role
Risk management platform development
Powered by
SAP
Bright Food, a state-owned Chinese food and beverages company, owns a rapidly expanding international portfolio of brands from Europe to Australia via its Hong Kong subsidiary, Bright Food International (BFI).
In 2021, PwC China helped BFI to implement a human-led, technology-driven risk management platform for BFI to detect and mitigate the diverse risks associated with its overseas entities in an intelligent, timely manner. In this first phase, the platform was first piloted in BFI, Hong Kong and Italy. During the programme’s second phase in 2023, the platform was updated with more risk indicators, including supply chain and working capital, and better AI-enabled technology. It was also rolled out to additional BFI subsidiaries in Shanghai and Australia.
When shoppers buy a bottle of Filippo Berio olive oil in Italy or Tnuva milk in Israel, they probably do not realise that these national brands are owned by Bright Food, a Chinese state enterprise based in Shanghai. The group’s expanding overseas food and beverages portfolio extends from Europe to Australia, with an international distribution network that is bringing Bright Food products to more and more customers around the world.

Bright Food faces the challenge of uniting diverse international management teams and workforces around the same corporate culture and mission in order to achieve its goal to become one of the world’s leading global food and beverages companies. In the past, Chinese state enterprises that have acquired international businesses have often struggled to overcome this hurdle. Instead, communication challenges and a failure to understand the corporate cultures and business practices of overseas subsidiaries have often led to misunderstandings, confusion and even a total breakdown of trust.
Bright Food International (BFI), the Hong Kong-based subsidiary which manages the group’s global portfolio, was conscious of these issues when it engaged PwC China to develop a risk and regulatory management framework and solution. BFI wanted a people-led, technology-driven platform to help the group surmount internal language, culture and communication barriers. In addition, BFI needed the platform to address increasingly stringent requirements by China’s state assets regulator for large companies to establish transparency throughout their foreign holdings.
PwC China was fully equipped to help BFI capture, visualise and evaluate risk across its diverse international portfolio. Our risk services team brought a wealth ofregulatory, technical and sector expertiseto the development of a platform that has enabled BFI to anticipate and avoid threats and hazards with greater foresight and agility.
The platform developed by PwC China’s risk services team for BFI uses SAP’s latest agile, cloud-based and compatible business risk management technologies to deliver a complete overhaul of the company’s governance, risk and compliance (GRC) architecture. The platform is designed to balance domestic and international regulatory requirements with BFI’s specific global risk management needs.
To meet these goals, our risk services team pioneered an integrated solution empowered by big data algorithms and applied statistical models to simulate and analyse behavioural traits. As a result, the platform both identifies risks across BFI’s global business operations and triggers alerts when potential deviations from trusted behavioural trends occur.
An advanced open-source Large Language Model (LLM) has since been integrated into the solution, enhancing BFI’s ability to conduct real-time compliance reviews in areas such as third-party risk, contract content risk, and cargo ownership.
“PwC’s new platform has created more transparency and trust throughout Bright Food International’s Hong Kong and overseas networks. The platform allows us to operate more effectively as one worldwide organisation with the same strategic goals.”
PwC’s platform enables more agile risk monitoring and faster alerts across BFI’s diverse global portfolio - for example, by eliminating many time-consuming manual reporting tasks, and by generating instant data and insights into current operations worldwide.
The outcome of this approach is already visible throughout BFI’s international network. Beyond its governance, risk and compliance (GRC) functions, the platform serves as an international touch point where BFI can discuss operational issues and business opportunities as soon as they arise with senior management teams at foreign subsidiaries. At a lower level, the platform also acts as an information-sharing hub for managers at individual Bright Food companies around the world. Ultimately, customers also benefit from these interactions, which enable Bright Food to make, distribute and sell better products globally.
“Our platform for Bright Food International draws on PwC’s technology and industry expertise to help one of China’s leading food and beverages companies transform its global risk and regulatory management systems.”
BFI’s new risk management platform depends critically on being “people-led”. With the global group’s internal communication in mind, we enabled leadership teams and managers at subsidiaries around the world to access the platform easily for business analytics.
In addition, the platform enables international colleagues to share their regional and industry perspectives with the parent group. All these exchanges are conducted in English, where previously the use of different languages on various national platforms formed a barrier to integrated, transparent global risk management and the development of a single worldwide corporate culture.
BFI’s platform illustrates how our “people-led”risk management solutionsdeliver measurable operational and commercial benefits in the fast-moving consumer goods sector, including:

SGTraDex — streamlining Singapore’s supply chain ecosystem via a central digital infrastructure
Industry
Transportation & logistics
Our role
Digital infrastructure design and implementation
Singapore’s Alliances for Action (AfA), a public-private partnership, engaged PwC to help build a common data highway calledSGTraDexOpens in a new window, with the goal of streamlining Singapore’s supply chain ecosystem and channeling information from disparate sources via a central digital infrastructure.
As part of AfA’s mission to promote Singapore’s economic growth, the government and industry group aimed for SGTraDex to be a trusted, efficient and resilient part of the country’s supply chain infrastructure. The group saw an opportunity to create a common data environment to enable information to flow seamlessly and mitigate the effects of supply chain disruptions.
It was critical that SGTraDex encompassed the diverse needs of the entire ecosystem, beginning with streamlining Singapore’s maritime logistics and optimising the flow of information for the movement of cargo for land transport.
Before designing and building the digital infrastructure, PwC focused on understanding the needs of multiple stakeholders in the land logistics ecosystem, with Singapore’s port as the main node. To this end, we initially conducted workshops with local and international companies that used the port to map current supply chain journeys, identify pain points and assess potential risks.
Drawing on this feedback, we defined the vision for the data-sharing platform and developed an operating model with functions such as marketing and governance that would demonstrate SGTraDex’s value.
Throughout this preparatory work, PwC Singapore’s Digital Solutions team leveraged our global expertise in helping complex organisations build end-to-end digital capabilities, and our local insights about how the new infrastructure could reinforce the critical role of land logistics flows in Singapore’s economy.
We built working prototypes for use cases covering the financing integrity of trade flows, the digitalisation of Singapore’s bunkering sector, the end-to-end visibility of container logistics movements, and creating visibility for the land transport of goods to and from the port.
These use cases were designed to show how the new platform would help stakeholders improve performance. For example, the container use case illustrated how SGTraDex would enable the exchange of timely data between shipping lines, hauliers and terminal operators to provide visibility of cargo movement in ports and other transportation nodes.
In June 2022, the data-sharing infrastructure went live. There were more than 70 participants, including large multinationals and local banks, and at the other end of the ecosystem, small- and medium-sized Singapore enterprises such as local hauliers and logistics firms.
Since the launch, PwC has continued to support SGTraDex in use case development and outreach – for example, drafting policies and providing technology assistance. This ongoing collaboration with SGTraDex is an outstanding example of PwC’s strategy to build trust and deliver sustained outcomes through people-led, tech-driven solutions.
“SGTraDex has benefited from PwC’s consulting expertise during the Alliance for Action phase. The team’s project management skills were well demonstrated and played a key role in successfully delivering Singapore’s first neutral and trusted data infrastructure, serving the trade, logistics, and maritime ecosystems.”
SGTraDex’s digital infrastructure is designed to enhance the efficiency and security of trade data flows by enabling seamless interactions between stakeholders.
Its interoperability allows different systems and platforms to exchange data securely and in real-time, reducing the risks of errors, fraud, and delays by providing all parties — from shipping companies to logistics firms — with accurate and timely data.
SGTraDex receives professional support from PwC in areas such as the mapping of data exchange flows, digitalisation of documents and processes, and processing bunkering and ship supplies, as it continues to build resilience in the supply chain ecosystem and protect value.
“Working closely with the public and private participants in the Alliance for Action to build a common digital infrastructure has shown that it is possible for many to come together when there is a common vision that will have a generational impact on Singapore.”
Ultimately, SGTraDex will help Singapore continue to be a major global trading centre in the digital age, where risks and hazards now range from conventional supply chain blockages to sophisticated cyber threats. Companies and consumers worldwide also stand to gain from a more robust, reliable supply chain for the goods and raw materials that are shipped through Singapore.
Our customised solution for SGTraDex is unique. Yet the skills and insights we deployed to design and implement the digital infrastructure can be seen in action every day on other large-scale, risk management projects around the world, where we are helping clients to modernise complex logistics systems with multiple stakeholders.
All our clients can expect:
See risk differently. Take risk intelligently to power growth. Build resilience to protect value.
From realigning your strategy and reimagining the power of your people, to recalibrating your capabilities, and driving value through data, we help you unlock new opportunities to create sustained outcomes for your people, your customers and your communities.

In our latest episode of Emerge Stronger through Disruption podcast series, our Global Centre for Crisis and Resilience co-leader Dave Stainback is joined by Matthew Duffey, PwC's Global Leader for Business Model Reinvention, to explore the critical need for Business Model Reinvention (BMR) and resilience in today's fast-paced business world, and how crises can serve as catalysts for transformation.
Release date: February 2025
David Stainback:Hello everyone, and thanks so much for joining us today for this episode of Emerge Stronger Through Disruption. I'm Dave Stainback, co-leader ofPwC’s Global Centre for Crisis and Resilience, and I'm coming to you today from my office in Atlanta, Georgia.
In our podcast series, my GCCR co-leader, Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles and I aim to tackle the challenges facing businesses in this environment of constant crisis and change, and really discuss how successful business leaders emerge stronger through disruption.
I'm very excited to be joined by Matt Duffey today, who's our Global Leader forBusiness Model Reinvention, or BMR at PwC, to explore how businesses can adapt and thrive in today's rapidly changing environment by successfully reinventing their business model and becoming resilient. Matt, welcome to the show.
Can you please give our listeners just a quick introduction of yourself and your role?
Matthew Duffey:Yeah, thanks Dave. Great to be here with you. I'm coming at you live from Dallas, Texas, but as you mentioned, I'm the lead for PwC’s Business Model Reinvention globally and with that, I've got the responsibility for helping to kinda roll this out across the network across all 135 of our territories, beginning to frame up our go-to-market strategy, working with our partners that have deep industry expertise to, you know, help pull together kind of what the next vision of industries is going to be, and just responsible for making sure that we operate as one network as we take this out to our clients.
David Stainback:That's great. Thanks Matt. I feel strongly that there's a direct tie in between your world of, of Business Model Reinvention and then, um, really our world of, of Crisis and Resilience.
And so I'm very excited that we get to do this together. To set the stage, can you first start off by explaining to our listeners what the concept of Business Model Reinvention or BMR really is?
Matthew Duffey: Absolutely. So Business Model Reinvention as we look at it, is about staying ahead of the curve. It's taking a look at your business model and going through a systematic process of understanding and designing new business models within it that can help unlock new revenue streams and help you expand upon your company's core business.
We like to talk about continuously reinventing a business model, because as you look at it in terms of the disruption and all the Megatrends that are hitting, our customers, there's a lot of changes that are gonna happen. There's a lot of changes in terms of customer preferences, changes in market dynamics, and if you're not always looking at reinventing yourself, it's very hard to maintain your relevance and stay competitive in this market.
Just to double click a little bit in terms of what we think of a business model and ultimately those aspects of it that you need to reinvent, we look at a business model, as you know, four very unique elements that interact with each other. And so it's the four of these that come together to create, deliver, and sustain value for your customers.
And the framework, essentially, it starts always with the value proposition for the customer. What is that unmet need that a customer has that your company needs to, meet them where they want to be met in order to create a value prop for that customer. Then it goes into the resources that you have as a company.
What are your assets, whether they're physical or just generally Intellectual Property (IP) and kind of what's your operating model? Then it gets into the capabilities and processes. You know, what are you inherently good at? As a company, whether that's M&A integration or supply chain excellence. And then finally we rounded out with the profit formula, or how are you gonna charge customers in a way in which it's commensurate with the value that they're expecting.
So our framework allows organisations to kind of understand their current state, but then also begin to take a look at, you know, where are they exposed, like what kind of potential threats are looming out there that they need to make sure that they tighten up and shore up every aspect of their business model or potentially face disruption.
David Stainback:Thanks, Matt. Yeah, no, that resonates a lot with my conversations with organisations frankly, around building resilience. As a resilience guy, two main themes I'm hearing from you are understanding your business models and the value propositions in a lot of detail, and then secondly, really recognising that you must constantly be reinventing and transforming as market conditions around you change, and from a resilience perspective, it's really key for companies to do just that, to understand exactly how your critical services and processes operate. Then be constantly assessing and preparing for what could potentially disrupt them.
Matthew Duffey:Yeah, absolutely. And one of the things that helps support us in this effort, right, is taking a look at the data and we have the pleasure, as you know, PwC, we have access to lots of CEOs. We are able to interview almost 4,000 of them and do a survey recently, the 28th CEO Survey. And our clients are coming out and saying that if they don't significantly change their business model in the next five to ten years, right, they're gonna be out of business and the data supports it.
Over 42% of the CEOs have indicated that they need to take a really hard look at their current business model and look to adapt it for the future trends that are coming at them. And so that's where we are looking to help our clients along this journey.
David Stainback:And really if you add to that, our findings from our most recent PwC Global Crisis and Resilience Survey, it really reinforces that with all of that going on and the way CEOs are thinking about it, but the fact that disruption is on the rise as well. So just the trends that we've seen back in 2019. Our survey indicated that about 69% of companies had suffered a major disruption at some point over a prior five-year period, but our most recent survey showed that that number's risen to 91%, have sustained a major disruption within just the last two years, and that data really even excludes the pandemic.
So just the fact that disruption is on the rise, I think there's justified reasoning as to why we're seeing some of these results in our CEO Survey as well, and frankly, the broader concern about disruption and trying to remain relevant. And I really think that's a nice segue into our next topic. So just for you, the way that we frame up PwC’s Enterprise Resilience model, it emphasises three main areas of resilience.
We talk about Operational Resilience, Financial Resilience. Strategic Resilience, and I'll talk about the last one first. We really define Strategic Resilience as that ability to evolve and to build agility into the organisation, really at that macro level like you're talking about. And to me, this is the area that's probably the most closely aligned to Business Model Reinvention.
Matthew Duffey:Yeah, a hundred percent. You know, I look at Strategic Resilience as kind of getting on your front foot, right? It's being more proactive, rather than reactive in business strategy, and that is exactly what we're trying to drive within BMR, right? It's how do you take a look at your business and begin to, you know, anticipate, adapt, and respond to some of these changes that are coming fast and furious at many of our C-Suite clients.
So it's taking a different look at it though, but beginning to see like, okay, what are the current risks that are in my business model that I need to shore up? Or if I don't, a competitor is going to take advantage of that, and come and disrupt me and begin to take market share from the market that I currently operate in with my current business model.
When you take a look at Strategic Resilience, I think it's definitely a great way to kind of systematically look at your business and begin to think about what changes do you need to make in order to get ahead of the market. Just try to bring this to life in terms of just some examples that we've been helping our clients with.
I mentioned earlier, you know, the CEO Survey. There's lots of examples in the market where our C-Suite executives are seeing the potential disruption come in their way, and they're being proactive about getting ahead of things and responding to things like Gen AI or climate change, or some of these regulatory changes that are coming our way and beginning to adapt their business models to meet the shifting needs of their customers.
A couple examples where we've helped some of our clients, you know, there's a large supermarket chain who took a look back at their business and through the impacts of climate change and sustainability where they operate, there's a large concern around, you know, the future energy demands on the grid within their country.
And so they looked at that as an opportunity. They have, you know, an asset base of large stores, right, with large rooftops where they said, how do we get into the energy game, right? We can go ahead and put solar panels on our roofs, begin to capture energy and sell that back into the grid. And so that's an example of a client taking a, you know, Megatrend shift in terms of what's going on with regards to climate change, and being able to optimise that and make money in a different way in the future.
Some other examples that we have where we're helping companies, you know, there's pharmaceutical companies where the prior business model has always been a B2B type model, and the companies looked at that and they said, well, how do we get closer to what the customer wants?
How can we get direct access to our customers? And yes, it's been tied up in regulatory requirements and things that we thought that prior companies felt like, you know, you just couldn't operate in a direct to consumer operating model. And we've been helping several of our pharma companies break down some of those silos and begin to operate more in a direct to consumer basis.
Then lastly, you know, another example where we've been helping guide some of our companies through Business Model Reinvention is with a construction company who had a very unique piece of software that they leveraged for their business, but then they realised that this was something that they could potentially sell in the market, and we helped them, one, not only become a software company, but then we help them move that piece of software into an as a service and consumption based business model.
David Stainback: I think those are great examples, Matt, and to your point, the survey also highlights that importance of, of really customer-centric innovation and just being alert to those types of external triggers for what your potential customer needs are. And I think all these examples clearly underscore that need for continuous innovation and adaptation and really trying to look at what risks or opportunities are in front of you that can give you a competitive advantage.
And clearly the focus of BMR is just that. To really understand what are those strategic opportunities in front of you, which aligns perfectly with the way that we begin to think about Strategic Resilience as well. So as a next step, I think it would also be interesting to focus on Operational Resilience.
It's a core part of our framework. It's probably at PwC, the part of the resilience framework that we spend the most time helping organisations with. And just for our listeners who may not be too familiar with it, the main focus of Operational Resilience or OpRes for short is kind of twofold. It's first to understand and identify what are a company's most critical business services and processes that it provides to its stakeholders, whomever those stakeholders might be.
So what is really critical to us? And then the second piece is, okay, let's take those critical business services and map out all of the component parts of each one of them, as well as their underlying processes by meticulously breaking them down to really understand all their key dependencies that enable them to operate.
So who are the people that support them? What are the technologies and applications that support them? What third party or vendors do we use that allow this critical process or service to run? And by doing that, you can really create and just identify where you have gaps and risks that you need to focus on building resilience around, and you end up doing that in the places that it really matters because it's already been identified as critical from the top down.
So I really view alignment here with BMR because from what we talked about earlier, there's such an important point of really needing to understand how your business operates in order for you to even go and reinvent yourself. And so I see some alignment here where we're doing a lot of work in helping companies to really break down all the core components of their business.
That might be helpful as a company is really looking at its BMR journey as well.
Matthew Duffey:Absolutely. There's a very tight linkage. I mean, one of the things that I like to say is it's really hard to, you know, advise a company on how they should reinvent themselves or how they should make money in the future if you don't know how they make money today.
Right. And I look at what you're talking about in terms of op model transformation and OpRes as being a key component of an overall BMR journey. If you take a look at the things that you're talking about, it's getting in and kind of understanding how the company operates today and making sure that it's resilient for the future, and that you begin to one shore up any potential gaps that you have, but also look to optimise and transform it for the current business model.
And that's all part of the journey that our companies go on. It's tighten up what you have today and make sure that that is performing as well as possible in order to give you the runway or the investment capacity to change for the future.
So when we talk about Business Model Reinvention, it is a journey, right? It's a three to five year journey that clients need to go on, but they need to get started. And oftentimes the best way to do that is to begin to take a look at your current operating model and see if it's fit for purpose for what you're selling and delivering today.
And then take a look at where you need to go to again, meet that unmet customer need and take a hard look and say, is that op model gonna work for that future business model that we need to get into?
David Stainback:Yeah, no, that's great. I think that makes a ton of sense. And we have these types of conversations all the time with organisations as they're thinking about it from a resilience lens.
So I think that there's an opportunity to make sure that they're thinking not just in the immediate, to your point, of how do I shore up what I'm doing today, but also be thinking that three to five year journey of how is my business gonna be changing, or how should I be changing my business as a result of potential disruptions coming my way?
So with that, let's shift gears a little bit from, we've been talking very much historically about resilience and readiness and things like that and how that relates to Business Model Reinvention, but I'd like to shift to the other half of what Bobbie and I and the rest of the GCCR at PwC focus on, which is crisis.
So the old saying goes, never waste a good crisis. And that's really because crises often act as catalysts for transformation. And Bobbie and I often say that there's two types of transformation. There's the normal strategic transformation, which is a lot of what we've been talking about so far, but then there's event driven transformation.
That occurs as a result of a major crisis or disruption. It's more of an acute event that then causes an organisation to really have to shift what it does, how it does it, and rethink who it is, and whether that's a cyber attack or some sort of operational failure, or reputational or scandal, something like that.
When faced with a crisis, what sets apart successful companies from the rest is how they use it as an opportunity to really transform their business. So naturally, crisis is also an opportunity to rapidly accelerate that Business Model Reinvention. So for somebody that's sort of struggling through it, we've seen a lot of organisations over time that have had that acute incident and almost had to do it overnight.
Can you share a couple examples of maybe how you've seen this play out in the BMR world?
Matthew Duffey:Yeah. You know, one of the things that we try to do in BMR is take a look back at history. A lot of the things that we see, they don't happen overnight. And so it's helpful to go back and look at companies and see where they started and kind of where they are today and see like what really drove it, right?
Like what was that event as you called it that caused them to pivot, and you know, one of the companies that comes to mind, the large technology company, a gaming provider, and think about how they went through a massive cyber incident, right? Hackers breached and exposed lots of information, credit card information, very sensitive stuff that put the company in a very tough position, right?
And what it forced them to do is to take a hard look at, you know, we'll call it their digital infrastructure, and realising that as a result of this, you know, they needed to overhaul it, right? And. As we keep talking about being more on their front foot, right? They were caught, you know, frankly on their back foot, right?
And like, how do they begin to take this, you know, I won't call it an opportunity, but this event that happened and turn it into a positive, you know, as a way of looking at their business model and taking a look and saying, okay, like we need to become much more resilient from our cybersecurity standpoint, but we need to move our overall business more into the digital era.
It's a more secure environment. Our customers want that. And so it was like an instance where it was a very difficult situation. But if you take a look at that company today, they've been able to migrate their business to more of a subscription based model, get into the streaming world. And that's frankly where customers want them to be.
Right? And so it was a great example of how a very difficult situation could force a company to have to take a hard look at their business model, but as a result, they came out of it much stronger today.
David Stainback:Yeah, I think that's a really powerful example and it highlights that importance of being agile and responsive to whatever might hit you, right, and thinking through immediately, not only how do I immediately respond and try to get back to normal, but how can I use this as an opportunity to really change my business?
For the better. And in our framework when we're going in and helping organisations, right? Really in that first, call it 48 hours to one week of a crisis event, we actually try to shift the conversation that way, right? There's obviously so much that's going on to try to keep our heads above water and things like that as we're responding.
But one of the things that we try to do within the first week or two is to help the organisation come up with a set of really transformational pillars, right? Three or four things that you use as guiding principles or posts to kind of look towards the future of how we're gonna really transform ourselves coming out of this, because we're already taking the hit, right?
We're taking the reputational hit, we're taking the financial hit of this type of an incident. Let's use this as the opportunity to say, okay, while we're recovering from this, we're gonna be shifting our thinking going forward and then create the narrative to these different transformational pillars so that you can begin to tell your stakeholders, Hey, we had this issue.
We apologize for this issue. If it was our fault in any way, but here's what we're gonna do about it and here's how we're gonna be a better organisation for you going forward. And, and we've seen that work. Those are the successful companies. So I think that following a crisis, you really need to have that strategic lens and frankly, that can be BMR right there.
I want to thank you, Matt. I think this is a great place to wrap up. Really, really interesting hearing your thoughts on BMR. It's been a great conversation.
Matthew Duffey:Yeah. Thanks Dave. Really enjoyed it. Had a lot of fun, uh, and hopefully our listeners enjoyed it as well.
David Stainback:Yeah. And to our listeners, thank you guys for all tuning in. In upcoming episodes of Emerge Stronger through Disruption, we're gonna continue to tackle the topics that keep business leaders up at night. We'd love to hear ideas from you about topics that you would like us to address, so please feel free to get in touch with both Bobbie and me via LinkedIn.
And in the meantime, remember to subscribe to Emerge Stronger, wherever you get your podcasts, and until next time, stay resilient and keep reinventing.

2025 Outlook
Michelle Ritchie
Global Industrials and Services Deals Leader, PwC United States
The M&A outlook for industrials and services (I&S) in 2025 is a story of growth, with deals activity likely to stem both from successful companies looking to boost growth and from struggling ones looking for solutions.
One overarching theme is that companies are focusing on acquisitions and investments in energy transition and services related to it. They are also acquiring new technologies and digital capabilities to stay competitive and expand market presence, with a particular emphasis on AI, automation and digital transformation—a key focus for companies across I&S subsectors. M&A activity will nonetheless play out differently by subsector, as follows:
CEOs are more confident about the M&A outlook than they have been over the past few years. M&A is an attractive option as they actively review portfolios and consider carve-outs and divestitures that would enable them to focus on core strategic growth areas, profitability and capital allocation. Companies are taking action to divest non-core or underperforming assets and reallocate capital resources to more profitable or growth-oriented areas. Following GE’s split into three public companies in 2024, and amid a broader trend toward spin-offs, we see a strong likelihood that other significant conglomerate break-ups in I&S will be announced in 2025.

The percentage of I&S CEOs planning to make an acquisition is marginally up from 79% last year, according to our latest CEO survey. Now that the big global election year of 2024 is behind us and inflationary pressures are easing, we expect deal activity to pick up in the near term.
Across the globe, there is a rising tone of protectionism in dealmaking and strategic alignment. Companies face the prospect of new tariffs and risk management issues in the supply chain—which already have led some companies to limit the geographic reach of their supply chains or nearshore some operations.

This geopolitical environment is leading dealmakers to focus on domestic M&A opportunities and may limit global expansion and international deal activity. The picture varies by region. In the United States, optimism is strong in part because of the decline in interest rates at the end of 2024 (although the trend is expected to slow in 2025) and easing inflationary pressure, both of which are creating more favourable economic conditions for M&A. Shifts in US regulatory and antitrust policies are expected to influence a greater number of larger, transformative deals, particularly in A&D and industrial manufacturing. In some European and Asian markets, uncertainty about growth, inflation and interest rate expectations persists. This is affecting buyer confidence and sustaining the valuation gap between buyers and sellers. Alternative financing (such as private capital) and structuring approaches (such as earnouts, partnerships and joint ventures) are being used more often to address risk, financing and valuation concerns.
Private equity (PE) is expected to play a role in increasing M&A activity, with substantial ‘dry powder’ ready to be deployed as financing difficulties ease. Examples of where PE is becoming more active include the construction sector, where small to medium-sized companies affected by macro- and microeconomic conditions are being consolidated, and automotive suppliers, where ‘roll-up’ consolidation opportunities exist in the current difficult market. Consolidations such as these create opportunities for a PE platform to align M&A opportunities with strategic objectives and leverage scale, leading to value creation and sustained outcomes.
‘I&S deal activity is coming back in 2025 with a roar, driven by improved macroeconomic conditions; the energy transition; roll-up and exit strategies; large, transformational approaches; and restructuring and realignment mandates—all through a global and domestic risk lens.’
Deal volumes and values in industrials and services decreased by 15% and 3%, respectively, between 2023 and 2024 but remain at approximately pre-pandemic levels. The continued decrease in M&A activity is attributable to the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, which continues to present challenges for dealmakers.
Regional performance varied, with deal volumes down 19% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); 17% in the Americas; and 9% in Asia Pacific. In Asia Pacific, India had an increase in deal volumes of 9%, and in China, although deal volumes decreased by 10%, there are indications that deals activity may be stabilising following three years of decreasing deal volumes. Deal values told a different story, with the Americas up 27% and with EMEA and Asia Pacific down by 20% and 17%, respectively. The regional variation was primarily because of megadeal (deals greater than $5bn) activity, with the Americas having six megadeals in 2024 compared with four in 2023.
Performance also varied across sectors. Deal volumes decreased between 2023 and 2024 across all sectors but to a different extent: aerospace and defence (A&D) by -35%; automotive by –18%; the usually more resilient business services sector by –18%; industrial manufacturing by –14% and engineering and construction by –8%. Deal values decreased in three sectors (automotive, business services and industrial manufacturing) and increased in two (A&D and engineering and construction) over the same period.
In the sector spotlights below, we outline the trends we expect to drive M&A activity in A&D, automotive, business services, engineering and construction, and industrial manufacturing in 2025.
Our commentary on M&A trends is based on data from industry-recognised sources and our own independent research. Specifically, deal values and volumes referenced in this publication are based on officially announced transactions, excluding rumoured and withdrawn transactions, as provided by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as of 31 December 2024 and as accessed between 6–9 January 2025. This has been supplemented by additional information from S&P Capital IQ, company filings and our independent research. Certain adjustments have been made to the source information to align with PwC’s industry mapping. All dollar amounts are in US dollars. Megadeals are defined as deals greater than $5bn in value.
