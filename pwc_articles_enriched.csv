Capturing value in the new agri-food domain of growth
By 2050, the world’s population will exceed nine billion. Providing healthy food for everyone while conserving land, water and energy is a daunting challenge. To meet it, fresh ideas and new collaborations are emerging, spanning the traditional boundaries of agriculture, technology and food value chains. Industries are reconfiguring. Production and distribution systems are being reshaped to focus on the essential goal of feeding the world. The result is a newdomain of growth, full of opportunities for new business models—we can help you seize them.

Consumers are demanding healthier, more sustainable food––driving the need for greater transparency. We need to know how food is produced, where it comes from and its environmental impact.
Meeting these expectations requires collaboration. Companies, regulators and stakeholders must work together to deliver better nutrition, sustainable consumption and global food security.
One third of the world’s food is wasted. From farm to store, the food value chain is inefficient and outdated. Climate change and geopolitics are adding risk. Building resilience is crucial.
There’s good news—solutions are within reach. New technologies are revolutionising how we produce, store and distribute food. And there’s significant room in food supply chains for sustainability wins and cost improvement.
By reducing waste, increasing transparency and making data-driven choices, we can transform agri-food supply chains.
It’s possible to meet rising food demand, support biodiversity and achieve net zero without harming the planet. But to do this, food production must become smarter and more sustainable.
Collaboration is critical—farmers, producers, retailers and governments working together to make it happen. Adopting innovative technologies, sustainable farming methods and forward-thinking business models.
As players across the food domain become more connected, advanced tech is solving the toughest problems and creating opportunities.
Satellites and drones are boosting productivity and conserving resources. Blockchain and the internet of things (IoT) are ensuring food traceability and safety. AI and precision fermentation are making production smarter and greener.
Across the world, the potential of tech-enabled, data-driven agriculture to increase yields, decrease costs and improve sustainability is enormous.
Our food system needs to work with, not against, nature. This means a reimagined domain that values natural resources accurately using both financial and non-financial metrics.
We’re working closely with agri-food businesses, consumer product companies, governments and other stakeholders. Together, we’re creating frameworks that will value and protect our natural assets.
A reconfiguration of the global economy means the value of the Feed domain could reach up to US$10.8 trillion in 2035. We’ve mapped the value in motion from now to 2035, so you can build a future-ready business to capture it.
See the shifts. Seize the value. Stay ahead.

Industries are reshaping around fundamental human needs, creating value through collaboration across interconnected domains that now replace traditional value chains.

As eMobility accelerates, a robust and accessible charging infrastructure will be critical to stimulate adoption and meet demand. The market is ripe for disruption—presenting opportunities for growth and value creation.
Adoption of EVs will have a profound impact on the automotive supply chain—from mining raw materials to after-sales maintenance. To thrive in this new mobility domain, you’ll need to be agile.
Smart mobility is harnessing data and technology to make transportation safer, more affordable and inclusive. People will have better transport experiences and greater choice. But it will take innovative, cross-sector collaboration and powerful public–private partnerships to make this real.
Tomorrow’s resilient, sustainable transport systems are bringing together innovative technologies such as AI, internet of things (IoT), sensors and data analytics. This is smart mobility tech—driving innovation and providing exciting opportunities for growth, and for changing the way we move.
A reconfiguration of the global economy means the value of the Move domain could reach up to US$6.4 trillion in 2035. We’ve mapped the value in motion from now to 2035, so you can build a future-ready business to capture it.See the shifts. Seize the value. Stay ahead.

The electric mobility transition is well underway. What are the key demand drivers and barriers for consumers? Which countries are best prepared?
Strategy& and PwC Autofacts have analyzed electric vehicle sales worldwide in the third quarter of 2024.
Cybersecurity will be a critical driver for electric vehicle growth. As governments across the GCC position eMobility as a key pillar of national transformation, learn about the vulnerabilities and critical measures needed to protect this complex ecosystem.
Whilst electric vehicles are a true megatrend for the 2020s, they are not the whole picture. To decarbonise by 2050, the world needs to embrace alternative fuels as well. Scalability and commercial viability will be key. Sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen and biofuels will become an important power source of the future.

As eMobility accelerates, a robust and accessible charging infrastructure will be critical to stimulate adoption and meet demand. The market is ripe for disruption—presenting opportunities for growth and value creation.
Adoption of EVs will have a profound impact on the automotive supply chain—from mining raw materials to after-sales maintenance. To thrive in this new mobility domain, you’ll need to be agile.
Smart mobility is harnessing data and technology to make transportation safer, more affordable and inclusive. People will have better transport experiences and greater choice. But it will take innovative, cross-sector collaboration and powerful public–private partnerships to make this real.
Tomorrow’s resilient, sustainable transport systems are bringing together innovative technologies such as AI, internet of things (IoT), sensors and data analytics. This is smart mobility tech—driving innovation and providing exciting opportunities for growth, and for changing the way we move.
A reconfiguration of the global economy means the value of the Move domain could reach up to US$6.4 trillion in 2035. We’ve mapped the value in motion from now to 2035, so you can build a future-ready business to capture it.See the shifts. Seize the value. Stay ahead.

Industries are reshaping around fundamental human needs, creating value through collaboration across interconnected domains that now replace traditional value chains.

Scalability and commercial viability will be key. Sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen and biofuels will become an important power source of the future.

Bright Food — enhancing trust and transparency through global risk and regulatory platform transform
Industry
Food and beverage
Our role
Risk management platform development
Powered by
SAP
Bright Food, a state-owned Chinese food and beverages company, owns a rapidly expanding international portfolio of brands from Europe to Australia via its Hong Kong subsidiary, Bright Food International (BFI).
In 2021, PwC China helped BFI to implement a human-led, technology-driven risk management platform for BFI to detect and mitigate the diverse risks associated with its overseas entities in an intelligent, timely manner. In this first phase, the platform was first piloted in BFI, Hong Kong and Italy. During the programme’s second phase in 2023, the platform was updated with more risk indicators, including supply chain and working capital, and better AI-enabled technology. It was also rolled out to additional BFI subsidiaries in Shanghai and Australia.
When shoppers buy a bottle of Filippo Berio olive oil in Italy or Tnuva milk in Israel, they probably do not realise that these national brands are owned by Bright Food, a Chinese state enterprise based in Shanghai. The group’s expanding overseas food and beverages portfolio extends from Europe to Australia, with an international distribution network that is bringing Bright Food products to more and more customers around the world.

Bright Food faces the challenge of uniting diverse international management teams and workforces around the same corporate culture and mission in order to achieve its goal to become one of the world’s leading global food and beverages companies. In the past, Chinese state enterprises that have acquired international businesses have often struggled to overcome this hurdle. Instead, communication challenges and a failure to understand the corporate cultures and business practices of overseas subsidiaries have often led to misunderstandings, confusion and even a total breakdown of trust.
Bright Food International (BFI), the Hong Kong-based subsidiary which manages the group’s global portfolio, was conscious of these issues when it engaged PwC China to develop a risk and regulatory management framework and solution. BFI wanted a people-led, technology-driven platform to help the group surmount internal language, culture and communication barriers. In addition, BFI needed the platform to address increasingly stringent requirements by China’s state assets regulator for large companies to establish transparency throughout their foreign holdings.
PwC China was fully equipped to help BFI capture, visualise and evaluate risk across its diverse international portfolio. Our risk services team brought a wealth ofregulatory, technical and sector expertiseto the development of a platform that has enabled BFI to anticipate and avoid threats and hazards with greater foresight and agility.
The platform developed by PwC China’s risk services team for BFI uses SAP’s latest agile, cloud-based and compatible business risk management technologies to deliver a complete overhaul of the company’s governance, risk and compliance (GRC) architecture. The platform is designed to balance domestic and international regulatory requirements with BFI’s specific global risk management needs.
To meet these goals, our risk services team pioneered an integrated solution empowered by big data algorithms and applied statistical models to simulate and analyse behavioural traits. As a result, the platform both identifies risks across BFI’s global business operations and triggers alerts when potential deviations from trusted behavioural trends occur.
An advanced open-source Large Language Model (LLM) has since been integrated into the solution, enhancing BFI’s ability to conduct real-time compliance reviews in areas such as third-party risk, contract content risk, and cargo ownership.
“PwC’s new platform has created more transparency and trust throughout Bright Food International’s Hong Kong and overseas networks. The platform allows us to operate more effectively as one worldwide organisation with the same strategic goals.”
PwC’s platform enables more agile risk monitoring and faster alerts across BFI’s diverse global portfolio - for example, by eliminating many time-consuming manual reporting tasks, and by generating instant data and insights into current operations worldwide.
The outcome of this approach is already visible throughout BFI’s international network. Beyond its governance, risk and compliance (GRC) functions, the platform serves as an international touch point where BFI can discuss operational issues and business opportunities as soon as they arise with senior management teams at foreign subsidiaries. At a lower level, the platform also acts as an information-sharing hub for managers at individual Bright Food companies around the world. Ultimately, customers also benefit from these interactions, which enable Bright Food to make, distribute and sell better products globally.
“Our platform for Bright Food International draws on PwC’s technology and industry expertise to help one of China’s leading food and beverages companies transform its global risk and regulatory management systems.”
BFI’s new risk management platform depends critically on being “people-led”. With the global group’s internal communication in mind, we enabled leadership teams and managers at subsidiaries around the world to access the platform easily for business analytics.
In addition, the platform enables international colleagues to share their regional and industry perspectives with the parent group. All these exchanges are conducted in English, where previously the use of different languages on various national platforms formed a barrier to integrated, transparent global risk management and the development of a single worldwide corporate culture.
BFI’s platform illustrates how our “people-led”risk management solutionsdeliver measurable operational and commercial benefits in the fast-moving consumer goods sector, including:

Bright Food — enhancing trust and transparency through global risk and regulatory platform transform
Industry
Food and beverage
Our role
Risk management platform development
Powered by
SAP
Bright Food, a state-owned Chinese food and beverages company, owns a rapidly expanding international portfolio of brands from Europe to Australia via its Hong Kong subsidiary, Bright Food International (BFI).
In 2021, PwC China helped BFI to implement a human-led, technology-driven risk management platform for BFI to detect and mitigate the diverse risks associated with its overseas entities in an intelligent, timely manner. In this first phase, the platform was first piloted in BFI, Hong Kong and Italy. During the programme’s second phase in 2023, the platform was updated with more risk indicators, including supply chain and working capital, and better AI-enabled technology. It was also rolled out to additional BFI subsidiaries in Shanghai and Australia.
When shoppers buy a bottle of Filippo Berio olive oil in Italy or Tnuva milk in Israel, they probably do not realise that these national brands are owned by Bright Food, a Chinese state enterprise based in Shanghai. The group’s expanding overseas food and beverages portfolio extends from Europe to Australia, with an international distribution network that is bringing Bright Food products to more and more customers around the world.

Bright Food faces the challenge of uniting diverse international management teams and workforces around the same corporate culture and mission in order to achieve its goal to become one of the world’s leading global food and beverages companies. In the past, Chinese state enterprises that have acquired international businesses have often struggled to overcome this hurdle. Instead, communication challenges and a failure to understand the corporate cultures and business practices of overseas subsidiaries have often led to misunderstandings, confusion and even a total breakdown of trust.
Bright Food International (BFI), the Hong Kong-based subsidiary which manages the group’s global portfolio, was conscious of these issues when it engaged PwC China to develop a risk and regulatory management framework and solution. BFI wanted a people-led, technology-driven platform to help the group surmount internal language, culture and communication barriers. In addition, BFI needed the platform to address increasingly stringent requirements by China’s state assets regulator for large companies to establish transparency throughout their foreign holdings.
PwC China was fully equipped to help BFI capture, visualise and evaluate risk across its diverse international portfolio. Our risk services team brought a wealth ofregulatory, technical and sector expertiseto the development of a platform that has enabled BFI to anticipate and avoid threats and hazards with greater foresight and agility.
The platform developed by PwC China’s risk services team for BFI uses SAP’s latest agile, cloud-based and compatible business risk management technologies to deliver a complete overhaul of the company’s governance, risk and compliance (GRC) architecture. The platform is designed to balance domestic and international regulatory requirements with BFI’s specific global risk management needs.
To meet these goals, our risk services team pioneered an integrated solution empowered by big data algorithms and applied statistical models to simulate and analyse behavioural traits. As a result, the platform both identifies risks across BFI’s global business operations and triggers alerts when potential deviations from trusted behavioural trends occur.
An advanced open-source Large Language Model (LLM) has since been integrated into the solution, enhancing BFI’s ability to conduct real-time compliance reviews in areas such as third-party risk, contract content risk, and cargo ownership.
“PwC’s new platform has created more transparency and trust throughout Bright Food International’s Hong Kong and overseas networks. The platform allows us to operate more effectively as one worldwide organisation with the same strategic goals.”
PwC’s platform enables more agile risk monitoring and faster alerts across BFI’s diverse global portfolio - for example, by eliminating many time-consuming manual reporting tasks, and by generating instant data and insights into current operations worldwide.
The outcome of this approach is already visible throughout BFI’s international network. Beyond its governance, risk and compliance (GRC) functions, the platform serves as an international touch point where BFI can discuss operational issues and business opportunities as soon as they arise with senior management teams at foreign subsidiaries. At a lower level, the platform also acts as an information-sharing hub for managers at individual Bright Food companies around the world. Ultimately, customers also benefit from these interactions, which enable Bright Food to make, distribute and sell better products globally.
“Our platform for Bright Food International draws on PwC’s technology and industry expertise to help one of China’s leading food and beverages companies transform its global risk and regulatory management systems.”
BFI’s new risk management platform depends critically on being “people-led”. With the global group’s internal communication in mind, we enabled leadership teams and managers at subsidiaries around the world to access the platform easily for business analytics.
In addition, the platform enables international colleagues to share their regional and industry perspectives with the parent group. All these exchanges are conducted in English, where previously the use of different languages on various national platforms formed a barrier to integrated, transparent global risk management and the development of a single worldwide corporate culture.
BFI’s platform illustrates how our “people-led”risk management solutionsdeliver measurable operational and commercial benefits in the fast-moving consumer goods sector, including:

SGTraDex — streamlining Singapore’s supply chain ecosystem via a central digital infrastructure
Industry
Transportation & logistics
Our role
Digital infrastructure design and implementation
Singapore’s Alliances for Action (AfA), a public-private partnership, engaged PwC to help build a common data highway calledSGTraDexOpens in a new window, with the goal of streamlining Singapore’s supply chain ecosystem and channeling information from disparate sources via a central digital infrastructure.
As part of AfA’s mission to promote Singapore’s economic growth, the government and industry group aimed for SGTraDex to be a trusted, efficient and resilient part of the country’s supply chain infrastructure. The group saw an opportunity to create a common data environment to enable information to flow seamlessly and mitigate the effects of supply chain disruptions.
It was critical that SGTraDex encompassed the diverse needs of the entire ecosystem, beginning with streamlining Singapore’s maritime logistics and optimising the flow of information for the movement of cargo for land transport.
Before designing and building the digital infrastructure, PwC focused on understanding the needs of multiple stakeholders in the land logistics ecosystem, with Singapore’s port as the main node. To this end, we initially conducted workshops with local and international companies that used the port to map current supply chain journeys, identify pain points and assess potential risks.
Drawing on this feedback, we defined the vision for the data-sharing platform and developed an operating model with functions such as marketing and governance that would demonstrate SGTraDex’s value.
Throughout this preparatory work, PwC Singapore’s Digital Solutions team leveraged our global expertise in helping complex organisations build end-to-end digital capabilities, and our local insights about how the new infrastructure could reinforce the critical role of land logistics flows in Singapore’s economy.
We built working prototypes for use cases covering the financing integrity of trade flows, the digitalisation of Singapore’s bunkering sector, the end-to-end visibility of container logistics movements, and creating visibility for the land transport of goods to and from the port.
These use cases were designed to show how the new platform would help stakeholders improve performance. For example, the container use case illustrated how SGTraDex would enable the exchange of timely data between shipping lines, hauliers and terminal operators to provide visibility of cargo movement in ports and other transportation nodes.
In June 2022, the data-sharing infrastructure went live. There were more than 70 participants, including large multinationals and local banks, and at the other end of the ecosystem, small- and medium-sized Singapore enterprises such as local hauliers and logistics firms.
Since the launch, PwC has continued to support SGTraDex in use case development and outreach – for example, drafting policies and providing technology assistance. This ongoing collaboration with SGTraDex is an outstanding example of PwC’s strategy to build trust and deliver sustained outcomes through people-led, tech-driven solutions.
“SGTraDex has benefited from PwC’s consulting expertise during the Alliance for Action phase. The team’s project management skills were well demonstrated and played a key role in successfully delivering Singapore’s first neutral and trusted data infrastructure, serving the trade, logistics, and maritime ecosystems.”
SGTraDex’s digital infrastructure is designed to enhance the efficiency and security of trade data flows by enabling seamless interactions between stakeholders.
Its interoperability allows different systems and platforms to exchange data securely and in real-time, reducing the risks of errors, fraud, and delays by providing all parties — from shipping companies to logistics firms — with accurate and timely data.
SGTraDex receives professional support from PwC in areas such as the mapping of data exchange flows, digitalisation of documents and processes, and processing bunkering and ship supplies, as it continues to build resilience in the supply chain ecosystem and protect value.
“Working closely with the public and private participants in the Alliance for Action to build a common digital infrastructure has shown that it is possible for many to come together when there is a common vision that will have a generational impact on Singapore.”
Ultimately, SGTraDex will help Singapore continue to be a major global trading centre in the digital age, where risks and hazards now range from conventional supply chain blockages to sophisticated cyber threats. Companies and consumers worldwide also stand to gain from a more robust, reliable supply chain for the goods and raw materials that are shipped through Singapore.
Our customised solution for SGTraDex is unique. Yet the skills and insights we deployed to design and implement the digital infrastructure can be seen in action every day on other large-scale, risk management projects around the world, where we are helping clients to modernise complex logistics systems with multiple stakeholders.
All our clients can expect:
See risk differently. Take risk intelligently to power growth. Build resilience to protect value.
From realigning your strategy and reimagining the power of your people, to recalibrating your capabilities, and driving value through data, we help you unlock new opportunities to create sustained outcomes for your people, your customers and your communities.

In our latest episode of Emerge Stronger through Disruption podcast series, our Global Centre for Crisis and Resilience co-leader Dave Stainback is joined by Matthew Duffey, PwC's Global Leader for Business Model Reinvention, to explore the critical need for Business Model Reinvention (BMR) and resilience in today's fast-paced business world, and how crises can serve as catalysts for transformation.
Release date: February 2025
David Stainback:Hello everyone, and thanks so much for joining us today for this episode of Emerge Stronger Through Disruption. I'm Dave Stainback, co-leader ofPwC’s Global Centre for Crisis and Resilience, and I'm coming to you today from my office in Atlanta, Georgia.
In our podcast series, my GCCR co-leader, Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles and I aim to tackle the challenges facing businesses in this environment of constant crisis and change, and really discuss how successful business leaders emerge stronger through disruption.
I'm very excited to be joined by Matt Duffey today, who's our Global Leader forBusiness Model Reinvention, or BMR at PwC, to explore how businesses can adapt and thrive in today's rapidly changing environment by successfully reinventing their business model and becoming resilient. Matt, welcome to the show.
Can you please give our listeners just a quick introduction of yourself and your role?
Matthew Duffey:Yeah, thanks Dave. Great to be here with you. I'm coming at you live from Dallas, Texas, but as you mentioned, I'm the lead for PwC’s Business Model Reinvention globally and with that, I've got the responsibility for helping to kinda roll this out across the network across all 135 of our territories, beginning to frame up our go-to-market strategy, working with our partners that have deep industry expertise to, you know, help pull together kind of what the next vision of industries is going to be, and just responsible for making sure that we operate as one network as we take this out to our clients.
David Stainback:That's great. Thanks Matt. I feel strongly that there's a direct tie in between your world of, of Business Model Reinvention and then, um, really our world of, of Crisis and Resilience.
And so I'm very excited that we get to do this together. To set the stage, can you first start off by explaining to our listeners what the concept of Business Model Reinvention or BMR really is?
Matthew Duffey: Absolutely. So Business Model Reinvention as we look at it, is about staying ahead of the curve. It's taking a look at your business model and going through a systematic process of understanding and designing new business models within it that can help unlock new revenue streams and help you expand upon your company's core business.
We like to talk about continuously reinventing a business model, because as you look at it in terms of the disruption and all the Megatrends that are hitting, our customers, there's a lot of changes that are gonna happen. There's a lot of changes in terms of customer preferences, changes in market dynamics, and if you're not always looking at reinventing yourself, it's very hard to maintain your relevance and stay competitive in this market.
Just to double click a little bit in terms of what we think of a business model and ultimately those aspects of it that you need to reinvent, we look at a business model, as you know, four very unique elements that interact with each other. And so it's the four of these that come together to create, deliver, and sustain value for your customers.
And the framework, essentially, it starts always with the value proposition for the customer. What is that unmet need that a customer has that your company needs to, meet them where they want to be met in order to create a value prop for that customer. Then it goes into the resources that you have as a company.
What are your assets, whether they're physical or just generally Intellectual Property (IP) and kind of what's your operating model? Then it gets into the capabilities and processes. You know, what are you inherently good at? As a company, whether that's M&A integration or supply chain excellence. And then finally we rounded out with the profit formula, or how are you gonna charge customers in a way in which it's commensurate with the value that they're expecting.
So our framework allows organisations to kind of understand their current state, but then also begin to take a look at, you know, where are they exposed, like what kind of potential threats are looming out there that they need to make sure that they tighten up and shore up every aspect of their business model or potentially face disruption.
David Stainback:Thanks, Matt. Yeah, no, that resonates a lot with my conversations with organisations frankly, around building resilience. As a resilience guy, two main themes I'm hearing from you are understanding your business models and the value propositions in a lot of detail, and then secondly, really recognising that you must constantly be reinventing and transforming as market conditions around you change, and from a resilience perspective, it's really key for companies to do just that, to understand exactly how your critical services and processes operate. Then be constantly assessing and preparing for what could potentially disrupt them.
Matthew Duffey:Yeah, absolutely. And one of the things that helps support us in this effort, right, is taking a look at the data and we have the pleasure, as you know, PwC, we have access to lots of CEOs. We are able to interview almost 4,000 of them and do a survey recently, the 28th CEO Survey. And our clients are coming out and saying that if they don't significantly change their business model in the next five to ten years, right, they're gonna be out of business and the data supports it.
Over 42% of the CEOs have indicated that they need to take a really hard look at their current business model and look to adapt it for the future trends that are coming at them. And so that's where we are looking to help our clients along this journey.
David Stainback:And really if you add to that, our findings from our most recent PwC Global Crisis and Resilience Survey, it really reinforces that with all of that going on and the way CEOs are thinking about it, but the fact that disruption is on the rise as well. So just the trends that we've seen back in 2019. Our survey indicated that about 69% of companies had suffered a major disruption at some point over a prior five-year period, but our most recent survey showed that that number's risen to 91%, have sustained a major disruption within just the last two years, and that data really even excludes the pandemic.
So just the fact that disruption is on the rise, I think there's justified reasoning as to why we're seeing some of these results in our CEO Survey as well, and frankly, the broader concern about disruption and trying to remain relevant. And I really think that's a nice segue into our next topic. So just for you, the way that we frame up PwC’s Enterprise Resilience model, it emphasises three main areas of resilience.
We talk about Operational Resilience, Financial Resilience. Strategic Resilience, and I'll talk about the last one first. We really define Strategic Resilience as that ability to evolve and to build agility into the organisation, really at that macro level like you're talking about. And to me, this is the area that's probably the most closely aligned to Business Model Reinvention.
Matthew Duffey:Yeah, a hundred percent. You know, I look at Strategic Resilience as kind of getting on your front foot, right? It's being more proactive, rather than reactive in business strategy, and that is exactly what we're trying to drive within BMR, right? It's how do you take a look at your business and begin to, you know, anticipate, adapt, and respond to some of these changes that are coming fast and furious at many of our C-Suite clients.
So it's taking a different look at it though, but beginning to see like, okay, what are the current risks that are in my business model that I need to shore up? Or if I don't, a competitor is going to take advantage of that, and come and disrupt me and begin to take market share from the market that I currently operate in with my current business model.
When you take a look at Strategic Resilience, I think it's definitely a great way to kind of systematically look at your business and begin to think about what changes do you need to make in order to get ahead of the market. Just try to bring this to life in terms of just some examples that we've been helping our clients with.
I mentioned earlier, you know, the CEO Survey. There's lots of examples in the market where our C-Suite executives are seeing the potential disruption come in their way, and they're being proactive about getting ahead of things and responding to things like Gen AI or climate change, or some of these regulatory changes that are coming our way and beginning to adapt their business models to meet the shifting needs of their customers.
A couple examples where we've helped some of our clients, you know, there's a large supermarket chain who took a look back at their business and through the impacts of climate change and sustainability where they operate, there's a large concern around, you know, the future energy demands on the grid within their country.
And so they looked at that as an opportunity. They have, you know, an asset base of large stores, right, with large rooftops where they said, how do we get into the energy game, right? We can go ahead and put solar panels on our roofs, begin to capture energy and sell that back into the grid. And so that's an example of a client taking a, you know, Megatrend shift in terms of what's going on with regards to climate change, and being able to optimise that and make money in a different way in the future.
Some other examples that we have where we're helping companies, you know, there's pharmaceutical companies where the prior business model has always been a B2B type model, and the companies looked at that and they said, well, how do we get closer to what the customer wants?
How can we get direct access to our customers? And yes, it's been tied up in regulatory requirements and things that we thought that prior companies felt like, you know, you just couldn't operate in a direct to consumer operating model. And we've been helping several of our pharma companies break down some of those silos and begin to operate more in a direct to consumer basis.
Then lastly, you know, another example where we've been helping guide some of our companies through Business Model Reinvention is with a construction company who had a very unique piece of software that they leveraged for their business, but then they realised that this was something that they could potentially sell in the market, and we helped them, one, not only become a software company, but then we help them move that piece of software into an as a service and consumption based business model.
David Stainback: I think those are great examples, Matt, and to your point, the survey also highlights that importance of, of really customer-centric innovation and just being alert to those types of external triggers for what your potential customer needs are. And I think all these examples clearly underscore that need for continuous innovation and adaptation and really trying to look at what risks or opportunities are in front of you that can give you a competitive advantage.
And clearly the focus of BMR is just that. To really understand what are those strategic opportunities in front of you, which aligns perfectly with the way that we begin to think about Strategic Resilience as well. So as a next step, I think it would also be interesting to focus on Operational Resilience.
It's a core part of our framework. It's probably at PwC, the part of the resilience framework that we spend the most time helping organisations with. And just for our listeners who may not be too familiar with it, the main focus of Operational Resilience or OpRes for short is kind of twofold. It's first to understand and identify what are a company's most critical business services and processes that it provides to its stakeholders, whomever those stakeholders might be.
So what is really critical to us? And then the second piece is, okay, let's take those critical business services and map out all of the component parts of each one of them, as well as their underlying processes by meticulously breaking them down to really understand all their key dependencies that enable them to operate.
So who are the people that support them? What are the technologies and applications that support them? What third party or vendors do we use that allow this critical process or service to run? And by doing that, you can really create and just identify where you have gaps and risks that you need to focus on building resilience around, and you end up doing that in the places that it really matters because it's already been identified as critical from the top down.
So I really view alignment here with BMR because from what we talked about earlier, there's such an important point of really needing to understand how your business operates in order for you to even go and reinvent yourself. And so I see some alignment here where we're doing a lot of work in helping companies to really break down all the core components of their business.
That might be helpful as a company is really looking at its BMR journey as well.
Matthew Duffey:Absolutely. There's a very tight linkage. I mean, one of the things that I like to say is it's really hard to, you know, advise a company on how they should reinvent themselves or how they should make money in the future if you don't know how they make money today.
Right. And I look at what you're talking about in terms of op model transformation and OpRes as being a key component of an overall BMR journey. If you take a look at the things that you're talking about, it's getting in and kind of understanding how the company operates today and making sure that it's resilient for the future, and that you begin to one shore up any potential gaps that you have, but also look to optimise and transform it for the current business model.
And that's all part of the journey that our companies go on. It's tighten up what you have today and make sure that that is performing as well as possible in order to give you the runway or the investment capacity to change for the future.
So when we talk about Business Model Reinvention, it is a journey, right? It's a three to five year journey that clients need to go on, but they need to get started. And oftentimes the best way to do that is to begin to take a look at your current operating model and see if it's fit for purpose for what you're selling and delivering today.
And then take a look at where you need to go to again, meet that unmet customer need and take a hard look and say, is that op model gonna work for that future business model that we need to get into?
David Stainback:Yeah, no, that's great. I think that makes a ton of sense. And we have these types of conversations all the time with organisations as they're thinking about it from a resilience lens.
So I think that there's an opportunity to make sure that they're thinking not just in the immediate, to your point, of how do I shore up what I'm doing today, but also be thinking that three to five year journey of how is my business gonna be changing, or how should I be changing my business as a result of potential disruptions coming my way?
So with that, let's shift gears a little bit from, we've been talking very much historically about resilience and readiness and things like that and how that relates to Business Model Reinvention, but I'd like to shift to the other half of what Bobbie and I and the rest of the GCCR at PwC focus on, which is crisis.
So the old saying goes, never waste a good crisis. And that's really because crises often act as catalysts for transformation. And Bobbie and I often say that there's two types of transformation. There's the normal strategic transformation, which is a lot of what we've been talking about so far, but then there's event driven transformation.
That occurs as a result of a major crisis or disruption. It's more of an acute event that then causes an organisation to really have to shift what it does, how it does it, and rethink who it is, and whether that's a cyber attack or some sort of operational failure, or reputational or scandal, something like that.
When faced with a crisis, what sets apart successful companies from the rest is how they use it as an opportunity to really transform their business. So naturally, crisis is also an opportunity to rapidly accelerate that Business Model Reinvention. So for somebody that's sort of struggling through it, we've seen a lot of organisations over time that have had that acute incident and almost had to do it overnight.
Can you share a couple examples of maybe how you've seen this play out in the BMR world?
Matthew Duffey:Yeah. You know, one of the things that we try to do in BMR is take a look back at history. A lot of the things that we see, they don't happen overnight. And so it's helpful to go back and look at companies and see where they started and kind of where they are today and see like what really drove it, right?
Like what was that event as you called it that caused them to pivot, and you know, one of the companies that comes to mind, the large technology company, a gaming provider, and think about how they went through a massive cyber incident, right? Hackers breached and exposed lots of information, credit card information, very sensitive stuff that put the company in a very tough position, right?
And what it forced them to do is to take a hard look at, you know, we'll call it their digital infrastructure, and realising that as a result of this, you know, they needed to overhaul it, right? And. As we keep talking about being more on their front foot, right? They were caught, you know, frankly on their back foot, right?
And like, how do they begin to take this, you know, I won't call it an opportunity, but this event that happened and turn it into a positive, you know, as a way of looking at their business model and taking a look and saying, okay, like we need to become much more resilient from our cybersecurity standpoint, but we need to move our overall business more into the digital era.
It's a more secure environment. Our customers want that. And so it was like an instance where it was a very difficult situation. But if you take a look at that company today, they've been able to migrate their business to more of a subscription based model, get into the streaming world. And that's frankly where customers want them to be.
Right? And so it was a great example of how a very difficult situation could force a company to have to take a hard look at their business model, but as a result, they came out of it much stronger today.
David Stainback:Yeah, I think that's a really powerful example and it highlights that importance of being agile and responsive to whatever might hit you, right, and thinking through immediately, not only how do I immediately respond and try to get back to normal, but how can I use this as an opportunity to really change my business?
For the better. And in our framework when we're going in and helping organisations, right? Really in that first, call it 48 hours to one week of a crisis event, we actually try to shift the conversation that way, right? There's obviously so much that's going on to try to keep our heads above water and things like that as we're responding.
But one of the things that we try to do within the first week or two is to help the organisation come up with a set of really transformational pillars, right? Three or four things that you use as guiding principles or posts to kind of look towards the future of how we're gonna really transform ourselves coming out of this, because we're already taking the hit, right?
We're taking the reputational hit, we're taking the financial hit of this type of an incident. Let's use this as the opportunity to say, okay, while we're recovering from this, we're gonna be shifting our thinking going forward and then create the narrative to these different transformational pillars so that you can begin to tell your stakeholders, Hey, we had this issue.
We apologize for this issue. If it was our fault in any way, but here's what we're gonna do about it and here's how we're gonna be a better organisation for you going forward. And, and we've seen that work. Those are the successful companies. So I think that following a crisis, you really need to have that strategic lens and frankly, that can be BMR right there.
I want to thank you, Matt. I think this is a great place to wrap up. Really, really interesting hearing your thoughts on BMR. It's been a great conversation.
Matthew Duffey:Yeah. Thanks Dave. Really enjoyed it. Had a lot of fun, uh, and hopefully our listeners enjoyed it as well.
David Stainback:Yeah. And to our listeners, thank you guys for all tuning in. In upcoming episodes of Emerge Stronger through Disruption, we're gonna continue to tackle the topics that keep business leaders up at night. We'd love to hear ideas from you about topics that you would like us to address, so please feel free to get in touch with both Bobbie and me via LinkedIn.

And our clients are coming out and saying that if they don't significantly change their business model in the next five to ten years, right, they're gonna be out of business and the data supports it.
Over 42% of the CEOs have indicated that they need to take a really hard look at their current business model and look to adapt it for the future trends that are coming at them. And so that's where we are looking to help our clients along this journey.
David Stainback:And really if you add to that, our findings from our most recent PwC Global Crisis and Resilience Survey, it really reinforces that with all of that going on and the way CEOs are thinking about it, but the fact that disruption is on the rise as well. So just the trends that we've seen back in 2019. Our survey indicated that about 69% of companies had suffered a major disruption at some point over a prior five-year period, but our most recent survey showed that that number's risen to 91%, have sustained a major disruption within just the last two years, and that data really even excludes the pandemic.
So just the fact that disruption is on the rise, I think there's justified reasoning as to why we're seeing some of these results in our CEO Survey as well, and frankly, the broader concern about disruption and trying to remain relevant. And I really think that's a nice segue into our next topic. So just for you, the way that we frame up PwC’s Enterprise Resilience model, it emphasises three main areas of resilience.
We talk about Operational Resilience, Financial Resilience. Strategic Resilience, and I'll talk about the last one first. We really define Strategic Resilience as that ability to evolve and to build agility into the organisation, really at that macro level like you're talking about. And to me, this is the area that's probably the most closely aligned to Business Model Reinvention.
Matthew Duffey:Yeah, a hundred percent. You know, I look at Strategic Resilience as kind of getting on your front foot, right? It's being more proactive, rather than reactive in business strategy, and that is exactly what we're trying to drive within BMR, right? It's how do you take a look at your business and begin to, you know, anticipate, adapt, and respond to some of these changes that are coming fast and furious at many of our C-Suite clients.
So it's taking a different look at it though, but beginning to see like, okay, what are the current risks that are in my business model that I need to shore up? Or if I don't, a competitor is going to take advantage of that, and come and disrupt me and begin to take market share from the market that I currently operate in with my current business model.
When you take a look at Strategic Resilience, I think it's definitely a great way to kind of systematically look at your business and begin to think about what changes do you need to make in order to get ahead of the market. Just try to bring this to life in terms of just some examples that we've been helping our clients with.
I mentioned earlier, you know, the CEO Survey. There's lots of examples in the market where our C-Suite executives are seeing the potential disruption come in their way, and they're being proactive about getting ahead of things and responding to things like Gen AI or climate change, or some of these regulatory changes that are coming our way and beginning to adapt their business models to meet the shifting needs of their customers.
A couple examples where we've helped some of our clients, you know, there's a large supermarket chain who took a look back at their business and through the impacts of climate change and sustainability where they operate, there's a large concern around, you know, the future energy demands on the grid within their country.
And so they looked at that as an opportunity. They have, you know, an asset base of large stores, right, with large rooftops where they said, how do we get into the energy game, right? We can go ahead and put solar panels on our roofs, begin to capture energy and sell that back into the grid. And so that's an example of a client taking a, you know, Megatrend shift in terms of what's going on with regards to climate change, and being able to optimise that and make money in a different way in the future.
Some other examples that we have where we're helping companies, you know, there's pharmaceutical companies where the prior business model has always been a B2B type model, and the companies looked at that and they said, well, how do we get closer to what the customer wants?
How can we get direct access to our customers? And yes, it's been tied up in regulatory requirements and things that we thought that prior companies felt like, you know, you just couldn't operate in a direct to consumer operating model. And we've been helping several of our pharma companies break down some of those silos and begin to operate more in a direct to consumer basis.
Then lastly, you know, another example where we've been helping guide some of our companies through Business Model Reinvention is with a construction company who had a very unique piece of software that they leveraged for their business, but then they realised that this was something that they could potentially sell in the market, and we helped them, one, not only become a software company, but then we help them move that piece of software into an as a service and consumption based business model.
David Stainback: I think those are great examples, Matt, and to your point, the survey also highlights that importance of, of really customer-centric innovation and just being alert to those types of external triggers for what your potential customer needs are. And I think all these examples clearly underscore that need for continuous innovation and adaptation and really trying to look at what risks or opportunities are in front of you that can give you a competitive advantage.
And clearly the focus of BMR is just that. To really understand what are those strategic opportunities in front of you, which aligns perfectly with the way that we begin to think about Strategic Resilience as well. So as a next step, I think it would also be interesting to focus on Operational Resilience.
It's a core part of our framework. It's probably at PwC, the part of the resilience framework that we spend the most time helping organisations with. And just for our listeners who may not be too familiar with it, the main focus of Operational Resilience or OpRes for short is kind of twofold. It's first to understand and identify what are a company's most critical business services and processes that it provides to its stakeholders, whomever those stakeholders might be.
So what is really critical to us? And then the second piece is, okay, let's take those critical business services and map out all of the component parts of each one of them, as well as their underlying processes by meticulously breaking them down to really understand all their key dependencies that enable them to operate.
So who are the people that support them? What are the technologies and applications that support them? What third party or vendors do we use that allow this critical process or service to run? And by doing that, you can really create and just identify where you have gaps and risks that you need to focus on building resilience around, and you end up doing that in the places that it really matters because it's already been identified as critical from the top down.
So I really view alignment here with BMR because from what we talked about earlier, there's such an important point of really needing to understand how your business operates in order for you to even go and reinvent yourself. And so I see some alignment here where we're doing a lot of work in helping companies to really break down all the core components of their business.
That might be helpful as a company is really looking at its BMR journey as well.
Matthew Duffey:Absolutely. There's a very tight linkage. I mean, one of the things that I like to say is it's really hard to, you know, advise a company on how they should reinvent themselves or how they should make money in the future if you don't know how they make money today.
Right. And I look at what you're talking about in terms of op model transformation and OpRes as being a key component of an overall BMR journey. If you take a look at the things that you're talking about, it's getting in and kind of understanding how the company operates today and making sure that it's resilient for the future, and that you begin to one shore up any potential gaps that you have, but also look to optimise and transform it for the current business model.
And that's all part of the journey that our companies go on. It's tighten up what you have today and make sure that that is performing as well as possible in order to give you the runway or the investment capacity to change for the future.
So when we talk about Business Model Reinvention, it is a journey, right? It's a three to five year journey that clients need to go on, but they need to get started. And oftentimes the best way to do that is to begin to take a look at your current operating model and see if it's fit for purpose for what you're selling and delivering today.
And then take a look at where you need to go to again, meet that unmet customer need and take a hard look and say, is that op model gonna work for that future business model that we need to get into?
David Stainback:Yeah, no, that's great. I think that makes a ton of sense. And we have these types of conversations all the time with organisations as they're thinking about it from a resilience lens.
So I think that there's an opportunity to make sure that they're thinking not just in the immediate, to your point, of how do I shore up what I'm doing today, but also be thinking that three to five year journey of how is my business gonna be changing, or how should I be changing my business as a result of potential disruptions coming my way?
So with that, let's shift gears a little bit from, we've been talking very much historically about resilience and readiness and things like that and how that relates to Business Model Reinvention, but I'd like to shift to the other half of what Bobbie and I and the rest of the GCCR at PwC focus on, which is crisis.
So the old saying goes, never waste a good crisis. And that's really because crises often act as catalysts for transformation. And Bobbie and I often say that there's two types of transformation. There's the normal strategic transformation, which is a lot of what we've been talking about so far, but then there's event driven transformation.
That occurs as a result of a major crisis or disruption. It's more of an acute event that then causes an organisation to really have to shift what it does, how it does it, and rethink who it is, and whether that's a cyber attack or some sort of operational failure, or reputational or scandal, something like that.
When faced with a crisis, what sets apart successful companies from the rest is how they use it as an opportunity to really transform their business. So naturally, crisis is also an opportunity to rapidly accelerate that Business Model Reinvention. So for somebody that's sort of struggling through it, we've seen a lot of organisations over time that have had that acute incident and almost had to do it overnight.
Can you share a couple examples of maybe how you've seen this play out in the BMR world?
Matthew Duffey:Yeah. You know, one of the things that we try to do in BMR is take a look back at history. A lot of the things that we see, they don't happen overnight. And so it's helpful to go back and look at companies and see where they started and kind of where they are today and see like what really drove it, right?
Like what was that event as you called it that caused them to pivot, and you know, one of the companies that comes to mind, the large technology company, a gaming provider, and think about how they went through a massive cyber incident, right? Hackers breached and exposed lots of information, credit card information, very sensitive stuff that put the company in a very tough position, right?
And what it forced them to do is to take a hard look at, you know, we'll call it their digital infrastructure, and realising that as a result of this, you know, they needed to overhaul it, right? And. As we keep talking about being more on their front foot, right? They were caught, you know, frankly on their back foot, right?
And like, how do they begin to take this, you know, I won't call it an opportunity, but this event that happened and turn it into a positive, you know, as a way of looking at their business model and taking a look and saying, okay, like we need to become much more resilient from our cybersecurity standpoint, but we need to move our overall business more into the digital era.
It's a more secure environment. Our customers want that. And so it was like an instance where it was a very difficult situation. But if you take a look at that company today, they've been able to migrate their business to more of a subscription based model, get into the streaming world. And that's frankly where customers want them to be.
Right? And so it was a great example of how a very difficult situation could force a company to have to take a hard look at their business model, but as a result, they came out of it much stronger today.
David Stainback:Yeah, I think that's a really powerful example and it highlights that importance of being agile and responsive to whatever might hit you, right, and thinking through immediately, not only how do I immediately respond and try to get back to normal, but how can I use this as an opportunity to really change my business?
For the better. And in our framework when we're going in and helping organisations, right? Really in that first, call it 48 hours to one week of a crisis event, we actually try to shift the conversation that way, right? There's obviously so much that's going on to try to keep our heads above water and things like that as we're responding.
But one of the things that we try to do within the first week or two is to help the organisation come up with a set of really transformational pillars, right? Three or four things that you use as guiding principles or posts to kind of look towards the future of how we're gonna really transform ourselves coming out of this, because we're already taking the hit, right?
We're taking the reputational hit, we're taking the financial hit of this type of an incident. Let's use this as the opportunity to say, okay, while we're recovering from this, we're gonna be shifting our thinking going forward and then create the narrative to these different transformational pillars so that you can begin to tell your stakeholders, Hey, we had this issue.
We apologize for this issue. If it was our fault in any way, but here's what we're gonna do about it and here's how we're gonna be a better organisation for you going forward. And, and we've seen that work. Those are the successful companies. So I think that following a crisis, you really need to have that strategic lens and frankly, that can be BMR right there.
I want to thank you, Matt. I think this is a great place to wrap up. Really, really interesting hearing your thoughts on BMR. It's been a great conversation.
Matthew Duffey:Yeah. Thanks Dave. Really enjoyed it. Had a lot of fun, uh, and hopefully our listeners enjoyed it as well.
David Stainback:Yeah. And to our listeners, thank you guys for all tuning in. In upcoming episodes of Emerge Stronger through Disruption, we're gonna continue to tackle the topics that keep business leaders up at night.

think business model ultimately those aspects you need reinvent look business model you know four very unique elements interact each other four these come together create deliver sustain value your customers framework essentially starts always value proposition customer what unmet need customer has your company needs meet them where they want met order create value prop customer then goes into resources you have company what your assets whether they physical just generally intellectual property kind what your operating model then gets into capabilities processes you know what you inherently good company whether integration supply chain excellence then finally rounded out profit formula how you gonna charge customers way which commensurate value they expecting our framework allows

every aspect their business model potentially face disruption david stainback thanks matt yeah resonates lot conversations organisations frankly around building resilience resilience guy two main themes hearing you understanding your business models value propositions lot detail then secondly really recognising you must constantly reinventing transforming market conditions around you change resilience perspective really key companies just understand exactly how your critical services processes operate then constantly assessing preparing what could potentially disrupt them matthew duffey yeah absolutely one things helps support effort right taking look data have pleasure you know pwc have access lots ceos able interview almost them survey recently ceo survey our clients coming out saying they don significantly change their business model next five ten years right they gonna out business data supports over ceos have indicated they need take really hard look their current business model look adapt future trends coming them where looking help our clients along journey david stainback really you add our findings our most recent pwc global crisis resilience survey really reinforces all going way ceos thinking about but fact disruption rise well just trends seen back our survey indicated about companies had suffered major disruption some point over prior five year period but our most recent survey showed number risen have sustained major disruption within just last two years data really even excludes pandemic just fact disruption rise think there justified reasoning why seeing some these results our ceo survey well frankly broader concern about disruption trying remain relevant really think nice segue into our next topic just you way frame pwc enterprise resilience model emphasises three main areas resilience talk about operational resilience financial resilience strategic resilience talk about last one first really define strategic resilience ability evolve build agility into organisation really macro level like you talking about area probably most closely aligned business model reinvention matthew duffey yeah hundred percent you know look strategic resilience kind getting your front foot right being more proactive rather than reactive business strategy exactly what trying drive within bmr right how you take look your business begin you know anticipate adapt respond some these changes coming fast furious many our suite clients taking different look though but beginning see like okay what current risks business model need shore don competitor going take advantage come disrupt begin take market share market currently operate current business model when you take look strategic resilience think definitely great way kind systematically look your business begin think about what changes you need make order get ahead market just try bring life terms just some examples been helping our clients mentioned earlier you know ceo survey there lots examples market where our suite executives seeing potential disruption come their way they being proactive about getting ahead things responding things like gen climate change some these regulatory changes coming our way beginning adapt their business models meet shifting needs their customers couple examples where helped some our clients you know there large supermarket chain who took look back their business through impacts climate change sustainability where they operate there large concern around you know future energy demands grid within their country they looked opportunity they have you know asset base large stores right large rooftops where they said how get into energy game right can ahead put solar panels our roofs begin capture energy sell back into grid example client taking you know megatrend shift terms what going regards climate change being able optimise make money different way future some other examples have where helping companies you know there pharmaceutical companies where prior business model has always been type model companies looked they said well how get closer what customer wants how can get direct access our customers yes been tied regulatory requirements things thought prior companies felt like you know you just couldn operate direct consumer operating model been helping several our pharma companies break down some those silos begin operate more direct consumer basis then lastly you know another example where been helping guide some our companies through business model reinvention construction company who had very unique piece software they leveraged their business but then they realised was something they could potentially sell market helped them one not only become software company but then help them move piece software into service consumption based business model david stainback think those great examples matt your point survey also highlights importance really customer centric innovation just being alert those types external triggers what your potential customer needs think all these examples clearly underscore need continuous innovation adaptation really trying look what risks opportunities front you can give you competitive advantage clearly focus bmr just really understand what those strategic opportunities front you which aligns perfectly way begin think about strategic resilience well next step think would also interesting focus operational resilience core part our framework probably pwc part resilience framework spend most time helping organisations just our listeners who may not too familiar main focus operational resilience opres short kind twofold first understand identify what company most critical business services processes provides its stakeholders whomever those stakeholders might what really critical then second piece okay let take those critical business services map out all component parts each one them well their underlying processes meticulously breaking them down really understand all their key dependencies enable them operate who people support them what technologies applications support them what third party vendors use allow critical process service run doing you can really create just identify where you have gaps risks you need focus building resilience around you end doing places really matters because already been identified critical top down really view alignment here bmr because what talked about earlier there such important point really needing understand how your business operates order you even reinvent yourself see some alignment here where doing lot work helping companies really break down all core components their business might helpful company really looking its bmr journey well matthew duffey absolutely there very tight linkage mean one things like say really hard you know advise company how they should reinvent themselves how they should make money future you don know how they make money today right look what you talking about terms model transformation opres being key component overall bmr journey you take look things you talking about getting kind understanding how company operates today making sure resilient future you begin one shore any potential gaps you have but also look optimise transform current business model all part journey our companies tighten what you have today make sure performing well possible order give you runway investment capacity change future when talk about business model reinvention journey right three five year journey clients need but they need get started oftentimes best way begin take look your current operating model see fit purpose what you selling delivering today then take look where you need again meet unmet customer need take hard look say model gonna work future business model need get into david stainback yeah great think makes ton sense have these types conversations all time organisations they thinking about resilience lens think there opportunity make sure they thinking not just immediate your point how shore what doing today but also thinking three five year journey how business gonna changing how should changing business result potential disruptions coming way let shift gears little bit been talking very much historically about resilience readiness things like how relates business model reinvention but like shift other half what bobbie rest gccr pwc focus which crisis old saying goes never waste good crisis really because crises often act catalysts transformation bobbie often say there two types transformation there normal strategic transformation which lot what been talking about far but then there event driven transformation occurs result major crisis disruption more acute event then causes organisation really have shift what does how does rethink who whether cyber attack some sort operational failure reputational scandal something like when faced crisis what sets apart successful companies rest how they use opportunity really transform their business naturally crisis also opportunity rapidly accelerate business model reinvention somebody sort struggling through seen lot organisations over time have had acute incident almost had overnight can you share couple examples maybe how you seen play out bmr world matthew duffey yeah you know one things try bmr take look back history lot things see they don happen overnight helpful back look companies see where they started kind where they today see like what really drove right like what was event you called caused them pivot you know one companies comes mind large technology company gaming provider think about how they went through massive cyber incident right hackers breached exposed lots information credit card information very sensitive stuff put company very tough position right what forced them take hard look you know call their digital infrastructure realising result you know they needed overhaul right keep talking about being more their front foot right they were caught you know frankly their back foot right like how they begin take you know won call opportunity but event happened turn into positive you know way looking their business model taking look saying okay like need become much more resilient our cybersecurity standpoint but need move our overall business more into digital era more secure environment our customers want was like instance where was very difficult situation but you take look company today they been able migrate their business more subscription based model get into streaming world frankly where customers want them right was great example how very difficult situation could force company have take hard look their business model but result they came out much stronger today david stainback yeah think really powerful example highlights importance being agile responsive whatever might hit you right thinking through immediately not only how immediately respond try get back normal but how can use opportunity really change business better our framework when going helping organisations right really first call hours one week crisis event actually try shift conversation way right there obviously much going try keep our heads above water things like responding but one things try within first week two help organisation come set really transformational pillars right three four things you use guiding principles posts kind look towards future how gonna really transform ourselves coming out because already taking hit right taking reputational hit taking financial hit type incident let use opportunity say okay while recovering gonna shifting our thinking going forward then create narrative these different transformational pillars you can begin tell your stakeholders hey had issue apologize issue was our fault any way but here what gonna about here how gonna better organisation you going forward seen work those successful companies think following crisis you really need have strategic lens frankly can bmr right there want thank you matt think great place wrap really really interesting hearing your thoughts

Islamic Financing
In this TP Talks Special Edition podcast, David Ledure (Global Financial Transactions Transfer Pricing Leader, PwC Belgium) is joined by Shereen Osman, (Financial Services Assurance Director and PwC’s Global Islamic Finance practice co-leader, PwC UAE), and Zachary Noteman (PwC’s Middle East Financial Transactions TP Leader).

2025 Outlook
Barry Jaber
Strategy&, Global Technology & Telecoms Deals Leader, PwC United Kingdom
Bart Spiegel
Global Entertainment & Media Deals Leader, PwC United States
Dealmakers are starting 2025 with greater optimism around M&A opportunities in the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) sectors. TMT is at the heart of the AI boom, which is both paving the way for deals and setting off a capital spending 'super cycle' that is seeing TMT companies invest in energy and real estate. At the same time, headwinds that slowed dealmaking in the past two years—including high inflation, the higher cost of capital, geopolitical tensions and regulatory challenges—have eased, particularly in the US, creating a more favourable dealmaking environment.
Global TMT deal volumes in 2024 were 27% below 2023 levels, but in early 2024 we started to see a recovery in deal values, particularly in the technology sector with several larger deals being announced. We expect this momentum to grow. The new US administration’s focus on deregulation may support more megadeal (deals greater than $5bn) activity in TMT, which, when combined with further interest rate cuts by central banks, could improve executive confidence—a key factor behind M&A. These macro factors—coupled with the proliferation of AI across sectors, the rivalry between new and traditional linear media, and the continued transition and delayering of the telecom industry—may drive an increase in both M&A volumes and values in 2025.

Technology continues to represent an outsized portion of the TMT sector, and we expect this will continue in 2025. In 2024, the technology sector accounted for 83% of TMT deal volume and 75% of TMT deal value. While deal volume in the technology sector declined 29% in 2024 compared to the prior year, deal value increased by 33% over the same period, indicating a trend toward larger deals. These increases were mostly driven by the software subsector which accounted for 65% of technology deal value in 2024.
Software deal volume declined by 33%, while deal value increased by 38% from $229bn in 2023 to $316bn in 2024. While fewer deals are occurring, software companies are being acquired at higher valuations compared to last year, reflecting rate reductions, the impact of AI and a recovery in equity markets.
‘The AI capex ""super cycle"" will present investment opportunities for many sources of capital. Combined with resurgent equity markets and valuations, and a significant backlog of PE exits, this will spur TMT M&A in 2025.’
The worldwide surge in interest in AI is leading to a sharp increase in capital expenditures that may affect other capital allocations. However, this shift increases opportunities to capture market share and value through strategic acquisitions lower in the value chain.
AI is attracting investment from corporates and private capital, particularly in countries where the technology is more advanced. The US, in particular, is attracting significant investment, not just from big tech players domestically but from overseas investors. In January 2025, President Trump announced a $500bn joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank which aims to build a network of data centres to power AI development in the US.
Corporates are choosing to invest in higher growth market segments such as data analytics, automation, language processing, and generative AI, to augment their current product or services and position for growth. Some of the largest deals of 2024 are emblematic of this trend. For instance, Cisco's $28bn acquisition of Splunk and HPE’s $14bn acquisition of Juniper Networks were driven in part by the desire to enhance AI networking capabilities. Similarly, Thomson Reuters’ acquisition of Materia was explained by Thomson Reuters Chief Product Officer David Wong as part of the company’s plan to ‘provide each professional we serve with a Gen AI assistant, transforming work and unifying the entire customer experience’.
The Chinese company DeepSeek has shown that highly capable large language models (LLMs) can be developed with significantly less investment than many had previously thought. Although this could have implications for mid-term capital expenditure on AI infrastructure, it is unlikely to diminish investment in the coming months as AI demand continues to grow. Additionally, there is considerable scope for further innovation in LLMs, and new model architectures may still prove to be resource hungry as researchers continue to push to new frontiers.
Substantial capital investments by major tech firms are causing a ripple effect through the value chain, creating vibrant M&A opportunities particularly around data centres and the energy solutions and infrastructure that support them.
Some of the most attractive assets in the AI space are already securing private equity (PE) investment as evidenced by DigitalBridge and Silver Lake’s $9.2bn equity investment in Vantage Data Centers, a global provider of hyperscale data centre campuses, which are considered to be better suited for AI’s increased demands on IT infrastructure.
According to Gartner, data centre capacity is expected to expand at a five-year CAGR of 28.3%, driven by the proliferation of big data analytics, the internet of things and generative AI. One especially notable example of this is Blackstone’s $16bn acquisition of AirTrunk which completed in December 2024. With this deal, Blackstone intends to capitalise on the estimated $2tn in capital expenditure projected to facilitate new data centre construction globally.
The build-out of these data centres presents significant challenges in both energy and resource management due to their high energy consumption. This has heightened interest in innovative energy solutions, such as nuclear power, which offers clean, carbon-free energy and high energy density. Recent transactions—such as Google’s deal with Kairos Power for small modular nuclear reactors and Amazon’s $650m acquisition of Talen’s nuclear data centre campus—underscore the strategic emphasis on integrating sustainable energy solutions into data centre operations, which is expected to be a deal driver throughout 2025. The market’s belief in the transformative potential of AI may actually mute some M&A activity in TMT as corporate players with strong balance sheets continue to divert capital to AI-related capital expenditure that may otherwise have been used for dealmaking. Nonetheless, we expect other factors may mitigate the impact on M&A, such as deregulation, which typically is supportive of corporate mergers and acquisitions.
In 2024, major technology companies like Amazon, Meta and Google significantly ramped up their capital expenditures, driven largely by their focus on AI, as noted above. For example, Microsoft, in its Q3 2024 earnings release, reported a 79% year-over-year increase in capital expenditures to $14bn, primarily for its Azure cloud platform. Similarly, Meta announced in its Q3 2024 earnings release that its capital expenditures grew 36% year over year. Despite these significant investments, supply chain constraints are limiting AI data centre capacity expansion, which leads us to expect a continuation of significant capital investment in 2025.
Elevated spending raises critical questions about the long-term implications for these traditionally high-margin businesses. Software firms now face substantial infrastructure spend to keep up with booming AI demand. As this trend becomes the norm, the traditional business model of high-margin, low-capital intensity software companies may be changing.
The regulatory environment for M&A in the TMT industry may begin to shift significantly under the new Trump administration in the US. Trump campaigned on policies that could reshape the regulatory environment, and his appointment of new chairs of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected to result in the introduction of new policies and potentially the reversal of some existing policies of the prior administration. For example, the FCC could ease regulations in the technology sector, and the FTC could take a less aggressive stance on antitrust enforcement. Tariffs and other trade restrictions could also be imposed. While these would be US policy measures, each would likely have global implications on other economies. From an M&A perspective, a deregulated environment is likely to boost M&A, but the complex regulatory landscape in the US and beyond will likely mean the impact on M&A trends will be territory and sector specific.
‘The global entertainment and media M&A landscape is poised for transformative change in 2025 thanks to pent up demand and anticipated deregulation.’
Markets are finally seeing some relief after a prolonged period of high interest rates that significantly increased the cost of capital and dampened M&A. The US Federal Reserve is expected to continue to gradually cut rates in 2025, as are the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. As access to lower-cost capital increases, we expect financial sponsors to account for a greater share of TMT deals, reversing a shift towards corporates which occurred during 2023 and 2024. Some of the largest TMT deals announced in the second half of 2024 show early signs of the resurgence of PE investment such as Blackstone’s aforementioned $16bn acquisition of AirTrunk, Blackstone and Permira’s $13bn proposed acquisition of Adevinta, and Blackstone and Vista’s $8.4bn proposed acquisition of Smartsheet.
TMT is well positioned to gain proportionately more than other sectors from potential rate cuts. The valuations of TMT companies ballooned during the pandemic on expectations of high growth and low interest rates. Now, the strength of the US equity market, as evidenced by the Nasdaq hitting all-time highs buoyed largely by the performance of Mega Cap TMT companies, is an indication of the sector’s rebound. Furthermore, assets that were acquired by PE at high valuations during the pandemic may now realise more palatable exit valuations as rates come down.
Semiconductors are riding the AI wave
The semiconductor sector is a core beneficiary of the AI surge. Behind the sudden rush of consumer-facing chatbots and B2B software upgrades with AI capabilities, lies a reliance on chips to power them. This, in turn, is driving demand for specialised semiconductors such as graphics processing units (GPUs) because of their parallel processing capabilities.
We expect to see continued investment throughout the semiconductor value chain as companies try to optimise their businesses for this new era. For example, Intel recently announced its plan to separate foundry operations into an independent subsidiary inside of Intel, while simultaneously announcing a deal to produce AI chips for Amazon. In November, the Biden-Harris administration in the US finalised $7.9bn in direct funding to Intel to support Intel’s $100bn investment plans to expand American semiconductor manufacturing and technology leadership. With the US CHIPS Act signed into law in 2022, many semiconductor companies will continue to receive federal subsidies over the next few years, further positioning the US semiconductor industry to capitalise on the growing AI market. Additionally, AMD’s proposed purchase of ZT Systems for $4.9bn aims to increase the company’s engineering and IP capabilities to compete in the AI data centre space, in which NVIDIA has been extremely successful.
The mix of PE and corporate deal activity demonstrates PEs conviction in the AI boom and many are placing bets. Semiconductor deal volume shifted towards corporate buyers by 7% in 2024 but deal value has shifted towards private equity buyers by 14%. So while corporates are still acquiring a greater number of semiconductor firms, deals transacted with PEs are commanding higher values. We expect increased PE investment in the space to continue into 2025, including investments in upstream beneficiaries of the AI boom.
IT services firms are becoming increasingly attractive
A trend towards large IT services transactions is taking shape, driven by the AI boom and the need for enhanced computing and storage capabilities. Recent deals in the IT services sector include the Blackstone acquisition of AirTrunk, X.AI’s $6bn equity financing and EQT’s $3bn acquisition of global digital consultancy and IT solutions provider Perficient.
The IT services sector represents an increasing portion of technology dealmaking. During 2024, IT services’ share of technology deal volumes increased from 14% to 18% and deal values increased from a 19% share to a 20% share. IT services average deal sizes tend to be higher than in the software sector ($146m versus $105m in 2024), and a growing number of megadeals suggests that IT services may be a more prominent focus for dealmakers in 2025. While the number of IT services deals are not expected to overtake those in software any time soon, we do see an opportunity for increased deal activity in the sector throughout 2025.
Software continues to occupy the top spot
Key technologies such as cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity are significant factors contributing to software M&A activity. In 2024, the software sector accounted for 65% of technology deal value and 48% of overall TMT deal value. Software deal value grew by 38% between 2023 and 2024, bolstered by some of the largest deals announced in TMT. To put software’s performance into perspective, deal values increased by $87bn between 2023 and 2024, surpassing the growth of the other technology subsectors by approximately 150%. Software deals accounted for half of the top 10 TMT deals in 2024.

Although software deal values have increased between 2023 and 2024, deal volumes remain down which is largely attributable to the macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory headwinds. However, the growth in deal values in a market with lower deal volumes illustrates the move towards larger, more strategic transactions and platform deals, a trend we expect to continue in 2025.
‘New Media’ is replacing the old guard
The recent US election highlighted an emerging trend across the global media landscape: new media has become a formidable competitor to the traditional linear media model, in which content is delivered according to a predetermined schedule. New media channels such as podcasts and YouTube, along with user generated content on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, have seen a significant increase in viewership over the years, often rivaling or even surpassing traditional channels such as broadcast or cable news. This shift is underscored by the current relevance of podcasts and social media as powerful vehicles for reaching large audiences, suggesting that this transition may already be well underway.
For example, US podcaster Joe Rogan’s interview with Donald Trump in October 2024 before the US election garnered approximately 26 million views on YouTube alone in its first 24 hours. That same month, initial viewing figures for cable TV channel CNN’s town hall with Kamala Harris were 3.3 million views. This stark contrast offers valuable insights into the rise of new media and should prompt many of the traditional media companies to re-evaluate their strategies, relevance and access to consumers.
Transformative M&A is considered a likely option as companies assess their current portfolios and look to divest non-core assets which don’t align with their future strategy. For example, the four-way split by the French mass-media holding company Vivendi, which separately listed its advertising company Havas, publishing firm Louis Hachette, and pay TV and film company Canal+ in December 2024 was intended to allow Vivendi to raise capital, reduce debt and focus on its core activities, while also attracting new investors and strategic partners for the separately listed businesses. Additionally, in November 2024, Comcast announced its plan to spin off its NBCUniversal cable TV networks, along with complementary digital assets.
As viewership patterns shift and new technologies emerge, understanding content reach and consumer engagement becomes more important than ever. Significant moves—such as Spotify signing Joe Rogan for $250m and, Amazon securing YouTube sensation Mr. Beast for $100m—illustrate the growing value of new media content. As new technologies reshape how consumers engage with content, companies that successfully adapt their strategies to these emerging media could gain a decisive competitive advantage.
Experiential live entertainment
With shifting demographics coming out of the pandemic, consumers have reoriented towards a love of immersive experiential entertainment ranging from live concerts and sporting events to content-specific immersive events. This change in customer behavior creates future revenue opportunities, specifically around monetising established intellectual property (IP). Additionally, live entertainment presents opportunities for unpaid marketing as eventgoers have a preference to share their experiences on social media.
We see this shift in consumer behavior occurring globally, and across sub-sectors. For example, Netflix has been actively monetising IP through The Squid Games Experience, a 60-minute live-action experience in New York’s Times Square. In 2025 Netflix also plans to open two permanent immersive experiential venues (with live events, gift shops, and restaurants) in Dallas and Pennsylvania. NBCUniversal Hollywood Horror Nights opened in locations across the world from Los Angeles to Singapore and Tokyo. In video games, Nintendo opened an interactive museum in Kyoto that is so popular that tickets are available only via a lottery system. These examples show how capital can be allocated to new media to leverage existing IP and promote yearlong revenue opportunities which may prompt further deal activity in 2025.
In sports, TGL is a new golf league created by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy that has started to host 3v3 tournaments in stadiums such as SoFi to promote simulation golf as a live sporting event. This provides further evidence of the shift away from the old-guard TV broadcast to a more immersive and engaging experience for viewers around the globe. Across industries we expect capital to flow into live experiential entertainment in different ways and through some novel deal structures.
Portfolio optimisation continues to produce stable deal flow
Portfolio optimisation continues to be a defining theme across the telecommunications sector. Telecom operators are continuously analysing their portfolios for value, with many moving toward a ‘puretone’ telecom model versus the multitone integrated model from years past. This means identifying opportunities to increase market share or delayering and carving out less-profitable elements to fund future growth.
Europe has seen continued activity related to portfolio optimisation, with large multinationals combining assets—such as the $19.5bn merger of Vodafone and Three. Furthermore, portfolio optimisation has been pronounced in the satellite and data centre subsectors, where deal activity has increased and has the potential to grow further in 2025. In Thailand, the $6.7bn merger and restructuring involving Gulf Energy Development, Intouch Holdings PCL, and Singtel Strategic Investments led to an increase in deal values in the Asia Pacific region. This deal, together with increased deal values more broadly, could signal returning deal flow and larger deal values in the telecom industry going forward, both in Asia Pacific and globally.
Dealmakers orbit the satellite sector
The biggest satellite deal of recent years (the $3.1bn merger of SES and Intelsat) was announced in 2024, and the geopolitical environment is poised to produce further tailwinds for the subsector. President Trump has close ties with Elon Musk, and his appointed FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, has supported satellite initiatives and historically voted against telecom regulation. This may prove to be a potent mixture for Musk’s SpaceX, creating a more favourable environment for transactions and prompting consolidation in the private satellite space. Furthermore, the attempted $9.75bn merger between Dish and DirecTV, even though it was ultimately abandoned, indicates appetite for industry consolidation.
increase in average deal size in the software sector between 2023 and 2024
Global TMT deal volumes in 2024 were 27% below 2023 levels, but in early 2024, we started to see a recovery in deal values across all sectors, with several larger deals being announced. TMT had 26 megadeals in 2024, more than double the 11 megadeals announced in 2023. In 2024, the technology sector accounted for 83% and 75% of TMT deal volumes and values, respectively.
On a regional basis, Asia Pacific, EMEA and the Americas all experienced declines in deal volume during 2024, but each maintained an approximate one-third share of the overall TMT global total. TMT deal values in the Americas increased by 46% between 2023 and 2024. Asia Pacific’s TMT deal values increased by 44% over the same period. By contrast, TMT deal values in EMEA declined by 4%.
A shifting market, where regulatory hurdles and high interest rates are diminishing encumbrances to deal-making, record dry powder, and a private equity exit backlog, coupled with significant innovation led by AI, will drive M&A activity in 2025 in TMT.
Our commentary on M&A trends is based on data from industry-recognised sources and our own independent research. Specifically, deal values and volumes referenced in this publication are based on officially announced transactions, excluding rumoured and withdrawn transactions, as provided by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as of 31 December 2024 and accessed between 6–9 January 2025. Our analysis has also been supplemented by additional information from S&P Capital IQ and our independent research. Certain adjustments have been made to the source information to align with PwC’s industry mapping.
All dollar amounts are in US dollars. Megadeals are defined as deals greater than $5bn in value. The average deal size is determined by dividing the total deal value by the number of deals that have a disclosed deal value. Any deals without a disclosed value are excluded from the calculation, ensuring that only deals with known values are used to determine the average.

Strategy&, Global Technology & Telecoms Deals Leader, PwC United Kingdom
Bart Spiegel
Global Entertainment & Media Deals Leader, PwC United States
Dealmakers are starting 2025 with greater optimism around M&A opportunities in the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) sectors. TMT is at the heart of the AI boom, which is both paving the way for deals and setting off a capital spending 'super cycle' that is seeing TMT companies invest in energy and real estate. At the same time, headwinds that slowed dealmaking in the past two years—including high inflation, the higher cost of capital, geopolitical tensions and regulatory challenges—have eased, particularly in the US, creating a more favourable dealmaking environment.
Global TMT deal volumes in 2024 were 27% below 2023 levels, but in early 2024 we started to see a recovery in deal values, particularly in the technology sector with several larger deals being announced. We expect this momentum to grow. The new US administration’s focus on deregulation may support more megadeal (deals greater than $5bn) activity in TMT, which, when combined with further interest rate cuts by central banks, could improve executive confidence—a key factor behind M&A. These macro factors—coupled with the proliferation of AI across sectors, the rivalry between new and traditional linear media, and the continued transition and delayering of the telecom industry—may drive an increase in both M&A volumes and values in 2025.

Technology continues to represent an outsized portion of the TMT sector, and we expect this will continue in 2025. In 2024, the technology sector accounted for 83% of TMT deal volume and 75% of TMT deal value. While deal volume in the technology sector declined 29% in 2024 compared to the prior year, deal value increased by 33% over the same period, indicating a trend toward larger deals. These increases were mostly driven by the software subsector which accounted for 65% of technology deal value in 2024.
Software deal volume declined by 33%, while deal value increased by 38% from $229bn in 2023 to $316bn in 2024. While fewer deals are occurring, software companies are being acquired at higher valuations compared to last year, reflecting rate reductions, the impact of AI and a recovery in equity markets.
‘The AI capex ""super cycle"" will present investment opportunities for many sources of capital. Combined with resurgent equity markets and valuations, and a significant backlog of PE exits, this will spur TMT M&A in 2025.’
The worldwide surge in interest in AI is leading to a sharp increase in capital expenditures that may affect other capital allocations. However, this shift increases opportunities to capture market share and value through strategic acquisitions lower in the value chain.
AI is attracting investment from corporates and private capital, particularly in countries where the technology is more advanced. The US, in particular, is attracting significant investment, not just from big tech players domestically but from overseas investors. In January 2025, President Trump announced a $500bn joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank which aims to build a network of data centres to power AI development in the US.
Corporates are choosing to invest in higher growth market segments such as data analytics, automation, language processing, and generative AI, to augment their current product or services and position for growth. Some of the largest deals of 2024 are emblematic of this trend. For instance, Cisco's $28bn acquisition of Splunk and HPE’s $14bn acquisition of Juniper Networks were driven in part by the desire to enhance AI networking capabilities. Similarly, Thomson Reuters’ acquisition of Materia was explained by Thomson Reuters Chief Product Officer David Wong as part of the company’s plan to ‘provide each professional we serve with a Gen AI assistant, transforming work and unifying the entire customer experience’.
The Chinese company DeepSeek has shown that highly capable large language models (LLMs) can be developed with significantly less investment than many had previously thought. Although this could have implications for mid-term capital expenditure on AI infrastructure, it is unlikely to diminish investment in the coming months as AI demand continues to grow. Additionally, there is considerable scope for further innovation in LLMs, and new model architectures may still prove to be resource hungry as researchers continue to push to new frontiers.
Substantial capital investments by major tech firms are causing a ripple effect through the value chain, creating vibrant M&A opportunities particularly around data centres and the energy solutions and infrastructure that support them.
Some of the most attractive assets in the AI space are already securing private equity (PE) investment as evidenced by DigitalBridge and Silver Lake’s $9.2bn equity investment in Vantage Data Centers, a global provider of hyperscale data centre campuses, which are considered to be better suited for AI’s increased demands on IT infrastructure.
According to Gartner, data centre capacity is expected to expand at a five-year CAGR of 28.3%, driven by the proliferation of big data analytics, the internet of things and generative AI. One especially notable example of this is Blackstone’s $16bn acquisition of AirTrunk which completed in December 2024. With this deal, Blackstone intends to capitalise on the estimated $2tn in capital expenditure projected to facilitate new data centre construction globally.
The build-out of these data centres presents significant challenges in both energy and resource management due to their high energy consumption. This has heightened interest in innovative energy solutions, such as nuclear power, which offers clean, carbon-free energy and high energy density. Recent transactions—such as Google’s deal with Kairos Power for small modular nuclear reactors and Amazon’s $650m acquisition of Talen’s nuclear data centre campus—underscore the strategic emphasis on integrating sustainable energy solutions into data centre operations, which is expected to be a deal driver throughout 2025. The market’s belief in the transformative potential of AI may actually mute some M&A activity in TMT as corporate players with strong balance sheets continue to divert capital to AI-related capital expenditure that may otherwise have been used for dealmaking. Nonetheless, we expect other factors may mitigate the impact on M&A, such as deregulation, which typically is supportive of corporate mergers and acquisitions.
In 2024, major technology companies like Amazon, Meta and Google significantly ramped up their capital expenditures, driven largely by their focus on AI, as noted above. For example, Microsoft, in its Q3 2024 earnings release, reported a 79% year-over-year increase in capital expenditures to $14bn, primarily for its Azure cloud platform. Similarly, Meta announced in its Q3 2024 earnings release that its capital expenditures grew 36% year over year. Despite these significant investments, supply chain constraints are limiting AI data centre capacity expansion, which leads us to expect a continuation of significant capital investment in 2025.
Elevated spending raises critical questions about the long-term implications for these traditionally high-margin businesses. Software firms now face substantial infrastructure spend to keep up with booming AI demand. As this trend becomes the norm, the traditional business model of high-margin, low-capital intensity software companies may be changing.
The regulatory environment for M&A in the TMT industry may begin to shift significantly under the new Trump administration in the US. Trump campaigned on policies that could reshape the regulatory environment, and his appointment of new chairs of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected to result in the introduction of new policies and potentially the reversal of some existing policies of the prior administration. For example, the FCC could ease regulations in the technology sector, and the FTC could take a less aggressive stance on antitrust enforcement. Tariffs and other trade restrictions could also be imposed. While these would be US policy measures, each would likely have global implications on other economies. From an M&A perspective, a deregulated environment is likely to boost M&A, but the complex regulatory landscape in the US and beyond will likely mean the impact on M&A trends will be territory and sector specific.
‘The global entertainment and media M&A landscape is poised for transformative change in 2025 thanks to pent up demand and anticipated deregulation.’
Markets are finally seeing some relief after a prolonged period of high interest rates that significantly increased the cost of capital and dampened M&A. The US Federal Reserve is expected to continue to gradually cut rates in 2025, as are the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. As access to lower-cost capital increases, we expect financial sponsors to account for a greater share of TMT deals, reversing a shift towards corporates which occurred during 2023 and 2024. Some of the largest TMT deals announced in the second half of 2024 show early signs of the resurgence of PE investment such as Blackstone’s aforementioned $16bn acquisition of AirTrunk, Blackstone and Permira’s $13bn proposed acquisition of Adevinta, and Blackstone and Vista’s $8.4bn proposed acquisition of Smartsheet.
TMT is well positioned to gain proportionately more than other sectors from potential rate cuts. The valuations of TMT companies ballooned during the pandemic on expectations of high growth and low interest rates. Now, the strength of the US equity market, as evidenced by the Nasdaq hitting all-time highs buoyed largely by the performance of Mega Cap TMT companies, is an indication of the sector’s rebound. Furthermore, assets that were acquired by PE at high valuations during the pandemic may now realise more palatable exit valuations as rates come down.
Semiconductors are riding the AI wave
The semiconductor sector is a core beneficiary of the AI surge. Behind the sudden rush of consumer-facing chatbots and B2B software upgrades with AI capabilities, lies a reliance on chips to power them. This, in turn, is driving demand for specialised semiconductors such as graphics processing units (GPUs) because of their parallel processing capabilities.
We expect to see continued investment throughout the semiconductor value chain as companies try to optimise their businesses for this new era. For example, Intel recently announced its plan to separate foundry operations into an independent subsidiary inside of Intel, while simultaneously announcing a deal to produce AI chips for Amazon. In November, the Biden-Harris administration in the US finalised $7.9bn in direct funding to Intel to support Intel’s $100bn investment plans to expand American semiconductor manufacturing and technology leadership. With the US CHIPS Act signed into law in 2022, many semiconductor companies will continue to receive federal subsidies over the next few years, further positioning the US semiconductor industry to capitalise on the growing AI market. Additionally, AMD’s proposed purchase of ZT Systems for $4.9bn aims to increase the company’s engineering and IP capabilities to compete in the AI data centre space, in which NVIDIA has been extremely successful.
The mix of PE and corporate deal activity demonstrates PEs conviction in the AI boom and many are placing bets. Semiconductor deal volume shifted towards corporate buyers by 7% in 2024 but deal value has shifted towards private equity buyers by 14%. So while corporates are still acquiring a greater number of semiconductor firms, deals transacted with PEs are commanding higher values. We expect increased PE investment in the space to continue into 2025, including investments in upstream beneficiaries of the AI boom.
IT services firms are becoming increasingly attractive
A trend towards large IT services transactions is taking shape, driven by the AI boom and the need for enhanced computing and storage capabilities. Recent deals in the IT services sector include the Blackstone acquisition of AirTrunk, X.AI’s $6bn equity financing and EQT’s $3bn acquisition of global digital consultancy and IT solutions provider Perficient.
The IT services sector represents an increasing portion of technology dealmaking. During 2024, IT services’ share of technology deal volumes increased from 14% to 18% and deal values increased from a 19% share to a 20% share. IT services average deal sizes tend to be higher than in the software sector ($146m versus $105m in 2024), and a growing number of megadeals suggests that IT services may be a more prominent focus for dealmakers in 2025. While the number of IT services deals are not expected to overtake those in software any time soon, we do see an opportunity for increased deal activity in the sector throughout 2025.
Software continues to occupy the top spot
Key technologies such as cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity are significant factors contributing to software M&A activity. In 2024, the software sector accounted for 65% of technology deal value and 48% of overall TMT deal value. Software deal value grew by 38% between 2023 and 2024, bolstered by some of the largest deals announced in TMT. To put software’s performance into perspective, deal values increased by $87bn between 2023 and 2024, surpassing the growth of the other technology subsectors by approximately 150%. Software deals accounted for half of the top 10 TMT deals in 2024.

Although software deal values have increased between 2023 and 2024, deal volumes remain down which is largely attributable to the macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory headwinds. However, the growth in deal values in a market with lower deal volumes illustrates the move towards larger, more strategic transactions and platform deals, a trend we expect to continue in 2025.
‘New Media’ is replacing the old guard
The recent US election highlighted an emerging trend across the global media landscape: new media has become a formidable competitor to the traditional linear media model, in which content is delivered according to a predetermined schedule. New media channels such as podcasts and YouTube, along with user generated content on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, have seen a significant increase in viewership over the years, often rivaling or even surpassing traditional channels such as broadcast or cable news. This shift is underscored by the current relevance of podcasts and social media as powerful vehicles for reaching large audiences, suggesting that this transition may already be well underway.
For example, US podcaster Joe Rogan’s interview with Donald Trump in October 2024 before the US election garnered approximately 26 million views on YouTube alone in its first 24 hours. That same month, initial viewing figures for cable TV channel CNN’s town hall with Kamala Harris were 3.3 million views. This stark contrast offers valuable insights into the rise of new media and should prompt many of the traditional media companies to re-evaluate their strategies, relevance and access to consumers.
Transformative M&A is considered a likely option as companies assess their current portfolios and look to divest non-core assets which don’t align with their future strategy. For example, the four-way split by the French mass-media holding company Vivendi, which separately listed its advertising company Havas, publishing firm Louis Hachette, and pay TV and film company Canal+ in December 2024 was intended to allow Vivendi to raise capital, reduce debt and focus on its core activities, while also attracting new investors and strategic partners for the separately listed businesses. Additionally, in November 2024, Comcast announced its plan to spin off its NBCUniversal cable TV networks, along with complementary digital assets.
As viewership patterns shift and new technologies emerge, understanding content reach and consumer engagement becomes more important than ever. Significant moves—such as Spotify signing Joe Rogan for $250m and, Amazon securing YouTube sensation Mr. Beast for $100m—illustrate the growing value of new media content. As new technologies reshape how consumers engage with content, companies that successfully adapt their strategies to these emerging media could gain a decisive competitive advantage.
Experiential live entertainment
With shifting demographics coming out of the pandemic, consumers have reoriented towards a love of immersive experiential entertainment ranging from live concerts and sporting events to content-specific immersive events. This change in customer behavior creates future revenue opportunities, specifically around monetising established intellectual property (IP). Additionally, live entertainment presents opportunities for unpaid marketing as eventgoers have a preference to share their experiences on social media.
We see this shift in consumer behavior occurring globally, and across sub-sectors. For example, Netflix has been actively monetising IP through The Squid Games Experience, a 60-minute live-action experience in New York’s Times Square. In 2025 Netflix also plans to open two permanent immersive experiential venues (with live events, gift shops, and restaurants) in Dallas and Pennsylvania. NBCUniversal Hollywood Horror Nights opened in locations across the world from Los Angeles to Singapore and Tokyo. In video games, Nintendo opened an interactive museum in Kyoto that is so popular that tickets are available only via a lottery system. These examples show how capital can be allocated to new media to leverage existing IP and promote yearlong revenue opportunities which may prompt further deal activity in 2025.
In sports, TGL is a new golf league created by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy that has started to host 3v3 tournaments in stadiums such as SoFi to promote simulation golf as a live sporting event. This provides further evidence of the shift away from the old-guard TV broadcast to a more immersive and engaging experience for viewers around the globe. Across industries we expect capital to flow into live experiential entertainment in different ways and through some novel deal structures.
Portfolio optimisation continues to produce stable deal flow
Portfolio optimisation continues to be a defining theme across the telecommunications sector. Telecom operators are continuously analysing their portfolios for value, with many moving toward a ‘puretone’ telecom model versus the multitone integrated model from years past. This means identifying opportunities to increase market share or delayering and carving out less-profitable elements to fund future growth.
Europe has seen continued activity related to portfolio optimisation, with large multinationals combining assets—such as the $19.5bn merger of Vodafone and Three. Furthermore, portfolio optimisation has been pronounced in the satellite and data centre subsectors, where deal activity has increased and has the potential to grow further in 2025. In Thailand, the $6.7bn merger and restructuring involving Gulf Energy Development, Intouch Holdings PCL, and Singtel Strategic Investments led to an increase in deal values in the Asia Pacific region. This deal, together with increased deal values more broadly, could signal returning deal flow and larger deal values in the telecom industry going forward, both in Asia Pacific and globally.
Dealmakers orbit the satellite sector
The biggest satellite deal of recent years (the $3.1bn merger of SES and Intelsat) was announced in 2024, and the geopolitical environment is poised to produce further tailwinds for the subsector. President Trump has close ties with Elon Musk, and his appointed FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, has supported satellite initiatives and historically voted against telecom regulation. This may prove to be a potent mixture for Musk’s SpaceX, creating a more favourable environment for transactions and prompting consolidation in the private satellite space. Furthermore, the attempted $9.75bn merger between Dish and DirecTV, even though it was ultimately abandoned, indicates appetite for industry consolidation.
increase in average deal size in the software sector between 2023 and 2024
Global TMT deal volumes in 2024 were 27% below 2023 levels, but in early 2024, we started to see a recovery in deal values across all sectors, with several larger deals being announced. TMT had 26 megadeals in 2024, more than double the 11 megadeals announced in 2023. In 2024, the technology sector accounted for 83% and 75% of TMT deal volumes and values, respectively.
On a regional basis, Asia Pacific, EMEA and the Americas all experienced declines in deal volume during 2024, but each maintained an approximate one-third share of the overall TMT global total. TMT deal values in the Americas increased by 46% between 2023 and 2024. Asia Pacific’s TMT deal values increased by 44% over the same period. By contrast, TMT deal values in EMEA declined by 4%.
A shifting market, where regulatory hurdles and high interest rates are diminishing encumbrances to deal-making, record dry powder, and a private equity exit backlog, coupled with significant innovation led by AI, will drive M&A activity in 2025 in TMT.
Our commentary on M&A trends is based on data from industry-recognised sources and our own independent research. Specifically, deal values and volumes referenced in this publication are based on officially announced transactions, excluding rumoured and withdrawn transactions, as provided by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as of 31 December 2024 and accessed between 6–9 January 2025. Our analysis has also been supplemented by additional information from S&P Capital IQ and our independent research. Certain adjustments have been made to the source information to align with PwC’s industry mapping.
All dollar amounts are in US dollars. Megadeals are defined as deals greater than $5bn in value. The average deal size is determined by dividing the total deal value by the number of deals that have a disclosed deal value. Any deals without a disclosed value are excluded from the calculation, ensuring that only deals with known values are used to determine the average.

2025 Outlook
Brian  Levy
Global Deals Industries Leader, PwC United States
The global M&A markets may finally be back on an upward trajectory as some of the economic and geopolitical uncertainties weighing on the market over the past couple of years lift. But will 2025 be a great M&A year or just another so-so one? Recent dealmaking momentum at the top end of the market suggests the upswing has already begun: the volume of deals greater than $1bn in value increased by 17% in 2024, and their average value rose. But we are also seeing some mixed signals: the volume of smaller and mid-sized deals fell by a meaningful 18% in 2024, and in the year ahead, dealmakers will need to keep their eye on some wild cards.
Deals that exceed $1bn only made up a sliver (about 1%) of the approximately 50,000 M&A deals announced globally last year, but these larger transactions often have an impact that goes beyond the actual acquisition in question. They set the tone for the whole market and grab the headlines. Executives seeing large deals happening around their industries often start to gain confidence to move forward more aggressively with their own M&A plans to stay competitive and for fear of missing out.
Several factors underlie the new-found M&A momentum. They include an intense CEO focus on growth and transformation in this new era of AI, greater capital availability, and an increased supply of assets expected to come to market—both private equity (PE) portfolio companies and non-core assets being divested by corporates. Nonetheless, dealmakers can’t ignore the wild cards, which include:
Volatile and uncertain geopolitics.Dealmakers and markets are still digesting the outcomes of the elections that took place in many countries during 2024 and the resulting changes to policy direction; in particular, the impact of the new Trump administration in the US as his policies and recent presidential executive orders, reverberate across the globe. Dealmakers should expect the unexpected.
Long-term interest rates are rising again.Inflation has continued to moderate, and central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have reduced interest rates in recent months. However, the momentum behind rate cuts has slowed, and with long-term interest rates rising in the US and elsewhere, this could make returns harder to find and lead to more challenging refinancing processes.
Valuations are high in some countries.In mid-January 2025, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for US stocks (based on the S&P 500) was 22.87, compared with 13.67 for non-US international stocks (based on the S&P International 700). Companies with higher valuations may use their stock as part of an inorganic growth strategy. We may also see more cross-border deals as US companies, buoyed by a strong US dollar, seek opportunities overseas, particularly in Europe.
‘An M&A recovery is overdue, but it may struggle to maintain its recent momentum at a time when long-term interest rates are rising and valuations are high. It’s a market that will distinguish top dealmakers from the rest. To be successful, they will need deep industry expertise and a laser focus on value.’
Several major global economies, such as Canada, France, Germany, and South Korea are facing political instability, and many have national elections in 2025. The impact of the Russia–Ukraine war, the potential calming of the conflict in the Middle East, and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria are events that also have a significant economic impact on the countries involved and their neighbours. We also can’t ignore the role of China on the geopolitical stage, given its position as the world’s second-largest economy and heightened political tensions in its relations with several countries.
The impact of the US election, in particular, is reverberating around the world, and the new administration’s policies may have significant—but at times contradictory—implications for M&A, not only in the US but also globally.
If the new US administration pushes through an agenda that is strong on deregulation and preserves or extends tax cuts, this could give a boost to growth and remove some barriers to dealmaking. However, we caution that sensitive areas that underlie national security, or deals involving access to large data pools, could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and will remain challenging.
A round of protectionist measures, including the imposition of tariffs, combined with potential retaliatory measures by other countries, could spark inflation and lead to increases in interest rates.
Trump has campaigned on a range of issues that could play out for M&A in different ways by sector, with any meaningful change serving as a catalyst for deals. For example:
Manufacturing, construction, agriculture, retail and healthcare.Policies to limit immigration might create labour shortages and spark inflation in these and other sectors. The imposition of tariffs may cause significant disruptions to supply chains for US multinationals that import goods into the country and may also create disruption for those exporting products if retaliatory action is taken.
Defence.Trump campaigned on a promise to end the wars in Russia–Ukraine and the Middle East. Although there is hope these conflicts will end this year, global defence spending is expected to continue. Focus areas may shift driven by the broader geopolitical landscape and potential for future conflicts but we expect strong defence budgets for at least the next ten years.
Energy production.A focus by the new US administration on increasing domestic oil and natural gas production will likely be a positive for the US energy sector. Despite uncertainties such as changes to the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy credits, renewable energy is expected to continue to benefit from long-term support for energy transition and AI’s growing demand for power.
Healthcare and pharma.Policy changes from the new Trump administration are expected to focus on disease prevention and personalised care, which will continue to spur innovation in the biopharmaceutical and healthcare sectors in the US. Although deregulation may benefit M&A in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, the potential threat of tariffs and impacts to global pharmaceutical supply chains will be important to monitor going forward.
Telecommunications.Trump’s appointed Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman, Brendan Carr, has supported satellite initiatives and historically voted against telecom regulation. This may create a more favourable environment for transactions and prompt consolidation in the private satellite and telecoms sectors.
Technology.After taking office, among other actions, Trump has reversed former president Biden’s executive order on AI safety standards and announced a $500bn joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank that aims to build a network of data centres across the US. Software companies may benefit from a less stringent stance from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), paving the way for more megadeal activity. However, the big tech and social media sectors may continue to face challenges, including calls for the biggest players to be broken up.
Successful dealmakers will be those who show an ability to navigate geopolitical issues rather than see them as obstacles. Investment decisions may ‘risk-off’ certain countries or favour others that align with trade alliances. Board and investment committee concerns will require dealmakers to factor geopolitics into their due diligence processes, which may add yet another important dimension to deal scorecards.
Regardless of which policies thenew Trump administrationenacts, dealmakers both in the US and internationally will need to be mindful of any transactions that involve strategic US technology or infrastructure or that could involve ownership of personal data of Americans. In other words, they will need to scrutinise deal ideas with a national security mindset, just as Trump and his team would.
The US Federal Reserve’s rate cuts in 2024, along with similar rate cuts by other central banks (including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England), have helped fuel the new M&A momentum to date. In the US, rates were cut by 100 basis points between September and December 2024. However, long-term rates have increased: the yield on a ten-year US Treasury note rose to just under 5% in early January. Long-term rates have also increased in the UK and other countries. This creates greater uncertainty regarding the timing and degree of future rate cuts in 2025. Further cuts will depend on the strength of the local economy and whether inflation continues to cool. Higher rates and slowing growth make deal economics more challenging.
Even though long-term rates have moved higher, yields in the leveraged loan market fell during 2024, largely because of growing competition between private credit and banks returning to the lending market. In 2024, lending by banks increased in the investment-grade debt market, high-yield bond market and leveraged loan market. Debt issuance in the US and European high-yield bond markets reached $388bn in 2024, up 74% from 2023. US and European leveraged loan market issuances more than doubled to $770bn in 2024. This greater capital availability helps provide the fuel for M&A.
The growing private credit market—which now has almost $1.7tn under management —has attracted its own wave of dealmaking. Many PE funds have acquired private credit firms to capitalise on the market’s growth potential. In September 2024, Brookfield made a $1.5bn strategic investment in Castlelake, an alternatives asset manager specialising in asset-based private credit; in December 2024, BlackRock announced its proposed acquisition of HPS Investment Partners—a firm that specialises in both private and public credit—for approximately $12bn.
As private credit lending has risen, unsurprisingly, the number of restructurings involving private credit has also gone up. In these situations, companies and their lenders engage in a process of renegotiating, restructuring or modifying the company’s debt obligations to improve financial stability and address distress. While the fundamental restructuring principles remain unchanged irrespective of the lender, the strong relationships between PE sponsors and private credit firms often lead to consensual solutions. Consensual measures include voluntary debt-equity exchanges or refinancings, whereas non-consensual ones include court-mandated restructurings and ‘cramdowns’—where terms are imposed on dissenting creditors or on shareholders to achieve a viable outcome. We expect that in 2025, there will be a continuation of the trend seen in 2024, in which there was an increase in the number of international restructurings, particularly in countries such as the US, UK, Netherlands, Brazil, and Singapore.
The new competition between banks and private credit has not only created a strong supply of capital for dealmaking but has also helped push down financing costs. However, the days of near-zero interest rates have gone, and while a lower cost of capital is good news for dealmakers, it remains elevated compared with levels of the past decade. To achieve the desired rates of return in an environment with higher interest rates, dealmakers need to apply an unrelenting focus on value creation. In a distress situation, early conversations between the company and its lenders will increase the likelihood of a consensual restructuring.
Three key trends in today’s market are intensifying and we believe they will heighten the deals imperative, leading to more M&A activity in 2025. First, companies are focused on growth and transformation; second, AI is acting as a catalyst for change and reinvention; and third, PE players are under increasing pressure to exit mature portfolio company investments.
According to PwC’s 28th Annual Global CEO Survey, published in January 2025, only 38% of CEOs were ‘extremely’ or ‘very’ confident about their company’s prospects for revenue growth over the next 12 months. That figure increased to 53% when respondents were asked about their company’s prospects over a three-year horizon. This suggests CEOs expect that current actions or future planned actions will lead to further growth of their company’s top line. This is especially important in an economic environment with slowing growth, in which many companies are finding organic revenue growth much harder to achieve.
M&A as a growth strategy
M&A continues to be an essential strategic element in helping companies shape their future, transform their business models and generate growth. Companies need to systematically review and rethink their value chains, distribution channels, customer communications, technology platforms and all other aspects of their operations to identify new ways of doing business to stay relevant, particularly in an environment that is being disrupted broadly by technology, specifically by AI, and universally by other global megatrends.
We expect that dealmaking activity will include acquisitions focused on both revenue and margin growth, with the intent of accessing new markets, enhancing capabilities and improving operational efficiencies. Given the significant costs of investing in technology and AI, the advantage goes to larger companies that have the investment capacity. We are also seeing a similar trend in highly regulated sectors such as banking and insurance, in which deals aimed at increasing scale can help spread anticipated cost increases associated with regulatory compliance across a wider customer base.
Divestitures to drive business transformation
Another trend we expect to see more of in 2025 is the refining of corporate portfolios as companies look to fill capability gaps and divest non-core or low-growth assets. In sectors including the industrials, consumer health and entertainment, among others, large corporates have been separating themselves from non-core business, either through spin-offs or sales. Recent examples include GE’s split into three public companies; Sanofi’s decision to transfer a controlling stake in its consumer health business, Opella, to CD&R, and Comcast’s plan to spin off its NBCUniversal cable TV networks, along with complementary digital assets.

Another factor that could significantly affect M&A is how the AI wave plays out at a company and market level as a catalyst for change and reinvention. For now, market expectations for AI and its potentially transformational capabilities are sky high, with about half of CEOs in our latest survey expecting GenAI to increase their company’s profitability in the year ahead. However, it's worth noting that actual performance is somewhat below CEO expectations expressed in last year's survey. In 2024, 46% said they expected to see profitability improvements. A year later, when asked if they had seen those gains, only 34% said they had.
Despite this, the conviction about the technology’s disruptive power continues—and as outcomes improve, we expect this to create M&A tailwinds, not only in the technology sector but across all sectors. Companies around the world are accelerating their transformations to adopt AI at scale, with the aim of creating greater efficiencies and new revenue opportunities, partnerships and processes. Those that figure out how to harness the power of AI may be able to turn it into a deal-making advantage.
AI is supercharging investments and attracting trillions of dollars in capital
AI is not only attracting investment in AI companies but also has supercharged investment in the digital infrastructure required to support it, including data centres and power generation capabilities. Capital expenditures of as much as $2tn are expected over the next five years to build and facilitate new data centres in the US and globally. The investment for now is predominantly taking the form of direct investments or partnerships versus traditional M&A.
ThisAI-led capital expenditure ‘super cycle’will likely affect M&A in two ways: first, there could be a crowding out of M&A as investor allocations shift from a strategy of ‘buy’ (via M&A) to one of ‘build’ (via capital expenditures, partnerships and strategic alliances); second, we expect to see more opportunities to capture market share and value by making strategic acquisitions of companies or assets that are positioned within the AI value chain.
Examples of investments in data centres and digital infrastructure include the following: DigitalBridge and Silver Lake’s $9.2bn equity investment in Vantage Data Centers, completed in June 2024; the AI partnership between BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft and a leading AI investor from the Middle East, announced in September 2024, to fund up to $100bn; Blackstone’s $16bn acquisition of AirTrunk, completed in December 2024; and the ‘Stargate’ joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle, announced in January 2025, to fund up to $500bn.
One example of an investment in power generation is Microsoft’s September 2024 signing of a power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to restart Crane Clean Energy Center (formerly Unit 1 of Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Station); another example is Google’s announcement in December 2024 of a new partnership with clean energy developer Intersect Power and with TPG, which plans to invest $20bn in renewable power infrastructure by 2030 to enable the buildout of new data centre capacity in the US, powered by clean energy.
These investments in data centres, digital infrastructure and power generation are emblematic of changes in the business landscape related to themes or domains of activity. These domains of activity are creating cross-sector dependencies that are leading to new business models, partnerships and avenues for growth, all of which are likely to boost further opportunities for dealmaking.
Over the past three years, below-average levels of PE exits have resulted in rising average holding periods for PE portfolio companies. We anticipate more PE-backed companies coming to the market in 2025 due to mounting pressure from limited partners on PE firms to exit these older investments. PitchBook data indicates that nearly half of the 29,400 PE portfolio companies worldwide have been held since 2020.
Deal values increased 5% between 2023 and 2024, whereas deal volumes decreased by 17% over the same period. Regional trends were similar to global, but varied at a country level. In the Americas, deal values in the US grew 6%; in EMEA, several megadeals in the UK led to an increase in deal values for the country—in contrast to many other European countries where deal values declined; and in Asia Pacific, Japan and India performed strongly with 24% and 20% increases in deal values, respectively. In terms of deal volumes, each region experienced a decline compared to 2023.

More $1bn plus deals.The number of deals valued at greater than $1bn increased from 430 in 2023 to more than 500 in 2024. This has boosted average deal sizes by 11%, to $146m in 2024. The number of small to mid-sized deals is still languishing, partly because of continuing valuation gaps between buyers and sellers and a challenging PE market.
Behind this upward trend in deals of more than $1bn are corporate dealmakers—some of them having been able to use their companies’ highly valued stock as currency—and top PE funds that are looking for larger deals as they raise historic amounts of capital.

Megadeals activity expands.Of the 502 deals in 2024 valued greater than $1bn, 72 were megadeals (deals greater than $5bn), compared to only 61 in 2023. In early 2024, most megadeal activity was in the technology, energy and banking sectors. However, in the second half of the year, we saw a broadening out into other sectors. In the second half of 2024, although technology remained in first place, insurance climbed to second place and media and entertainment came in third place.
In 2024, each of the top three deals was in a different sector: in retail, Couche-Tard’s $39bn offer to acquire Seven & i Holdings Co (known for its 7-Eleven franchise); in banking, Capital One’s proposed $35.3bn acquisition of Discover Financial Services; and in software, Synopsys’ proposed $32.5bn acquisition of Ansys.
Deal values increase in many sectors.Several sectors had higher deal values in 2024 than in 2023, with entertainment and media, technology, and aerospace and defence, as well as the financial services sectors of banking, insurance and asset and wealth management all having some notable megadeals. Deal values in the pharma and life sciences sector decreased by 36% in 2024 because of a drop in the number of megadeals (from ten in 2023 to four in 2024). Deal values also decreased in the oil and gas sector because of two deals worth more than $50bn each announced in 2023.
Deal volumes declined across all sectors.Every sector saw a decrease in deal volumes between 2023 and 2024, although the decreases varied from -2% for the mining sector to -27% in the technology sector.
‘We are seeing the long-awaited recovery in M&A broadening out to more sectors and more countries and with more large deals. All of this is giving “legs” to the momentum that started already in 2024, but the potential for surprises, both good and bad, remains high. Dealmakers will need to keep a close eye on valuations, interest rates and geopolitics in the year ahead.’
One of the latest M&A developments—and one which looks set to become a broader trend—is the growing convergence among sectors around particular themes. AI infrastructure is a case in point: the huge amount of computing power AI needs to process reams of data in a very short time requires a tidal wave of investment info semiconductors, data centers, and digital infrastructure. As a result, for the first time in decades demand is outstripping our energy capacity. Accordingly, the past few months have seen deals bringing together tech companies with energy providers and real estate players to build data centers and other major new digital infrastructure. EXAMPLES We are seeing record new capital formation through partnerships with players that had preciously not tied themselves together from big tech – the Mag 7, sovereign wealth funds, traditional PR and infrastructure. The investment needs over the next few years could easily be in over a trillion US dollars This has supercharged deals in the digital infrastructure space igniting a fire under data centers and interestingly, these deals don’t resemble traditional M&A – they have been more akin to growth capital transactions, but on a scale creating billions in investments and partnerships. We expect these new era growth capital deals to continue to proliferate in energy and data centers, in particular. However, we pause to question whether this massive capital spend will mean that big tech companies, PE and others allocate less to M&A transactions, in what would amount to a crowding out of deals as “build” replaces “buy”.
The rise of AI plays into another major theme that will fuel M&A in 2025: corporate transformations and business model reinvention. As the AI infrastructure absorbs the capital at a record pace the onus shifts to companies across every industry to invest in leveraging AI to reinvent themselves – through the greatest catalyst in history to disrupt, reinvent, innovate and create new revenue opportunities, new partnerships, new processes and reduce costs. These have long been an essential driver of M&A activity and many global companies have announced carve-outs and disposals of some assets they deem non-core in order to refine and narrow their strategic focus. AI will act as a spur to this corporate refocusing. It promises greater growth and productivity, but also require new skills, capabilities, corporate structures, and cultures. Acquisitions can help laggards get up to speed faster, but, beyond that, a judgement of the AI readiness of potential target companies will become a necessity: dealmakers will need to build a case around how AI will or won’t affect every new deal, and we expect the thesis to state that it will impact the deal and therefore dealmakers will be forced to scenario plan and understand the sensitivities of returns.
Capital availability and interest rates will be a third major driver of M&A in 2025. Yields in the leveraged loan market in the US have come down in the back half of this year, even though the rates for 10-year Treasury notes have risen. That is largely the result of growing competition between private credit —who now have almost $1.9 trillion under management—and banks returning to the lending market. Private credit shows no sign of slowing its growth. The end result is a good one for dealmakers, because it means that ever more capital is available at even more competitive prices, at a time when interest rates appear to have stabilized and may have further to fall. We note that despite cooling inflation the market remains concerned about getting inflation to the 2% target, and the US Fed just shifted its rate expectations to only 2 cuts vs four for 2025. If inflation creeps back in the market will not react kindly.
Finally, politics will be a wild card for M&A. For his second term as US President, Donald Trump is promising large-scale deregulation, a more favourable tax regime, the threat if not promise of tariffs, and a public-sector transformation initiative of its own focused on eliminating regulations, efficiency and cost-savings led by two entrepreneurs, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Even before his inauguration, key appointments to US regulatory agencies suggested a less interventionist touch in overseeing mergers and acquisition than under the Biden Administration. Yet questions remain about how far any deregulation or tax cuts could go—and whether their effect on the US and global economy would be offset by protectionist moves including tariffs on imported goods and services that could crimp growth and stoke inflation. The geopolitical world seems to have hopes of more stability and peace but there are unlimited examples of new challenges that have already cropped up including destabilization and no confidence votes in many countries such as Canada, South Korea, France and Germany and others like Syria where rebels have overthrown long standing regimes, all further clouding the geopolitical skies, without mentioning the ongoing wars. If the Trump effect is already having such far reaching implications across the world before his inauguration, what will happen on Jan 21st?
CEO confidence has improved post election. Importantly, the outright contrast between the Trump administration and its pro business fundamentals versus the restrictive policies of the prior government are duly noted. We expect major changes in key industries such as healthcare, pharma and food as the Make America Healthy Again mantra promoted by RFK Jr and his nomination as secretary of Health and Human Services. Additionally, defense, aerospace and industries selling to the government will be put under pressure as the aforementioned DOGE embarks on its mission. Technology and social media will likewise face challenges as calls for breaking up these powerhouses continue and the impact of the Tik Tok ban (or its reversal) loom large. These are just a few industries that will be in the crosshairs of the new administration and any changes could be a catalyst for M&A, particularly in the back half of 2025.
To be successful, dealmakers will need to be prepared to answer some tough questions, including the following:
How could AI affect the business model of the company you plan to acquire? This will require critical analysis and scenario planning, including factoring in the cost of enabling AI at the target or acquiring company.
In a market with robust valuations and slowing economic growth in some countries, how can returns meet expectations? This will require making value creation a priority and building accountability frameworks.
What alternative options exist in the event of a failed refinancing or a difficult, delayed or halted M&A process due to the debt surpassing the company’s enterprise value? In such situations, dealmakers will need to develop a plan B, or even a plan C.
Where in the world are there still opportunities for investors? Cross-border opportunities may become more challenging, but the risk may be worth the reward with thoughtful linkage between corporate strategy, deal thesis and country geopolitical risk assessment.
What are the geopolitical implications, including for national security, of any deal being considered? Careful scenario planning, including creating a framework of corporate agility and strong contingency plans, will pay dividends.
These are indeed complicated times for the M&A markets. So much seems to be in place for a resurgence of dealmaking on both the buy side and the sell side. Yet some important aspects, from valuations and interest rates to geopolitics, create pressure that can’t easily be brushed aside. Market expectations for an M&A rebound have disappointed over the past two years, and there are no guarantees that this new dawn for M&A in 2025 won’t prove to be another false dawn. Yet this time, many more of the stars are aligned. If the large deal activity continues, in a market like this, momentum can quickly become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The stakes are high, and the trajectory may well not be linear, but we are confident that the momentum for M&A in 2025 will be there, particularly in the second half. But will it be enough to make M&A great again? We surely hope so—and financial markets are counting on it.
Our commentary on M&A trends is based on data from industry-recognised sources and our own independent research. Specifically, deal volumes and values referenced in this publication are based on officially announced transactions, excluding rumoured and withdrawn transactions, as provided by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as of 31 December 2024 and accessed between 6-9 January 2025. The number of PE portfolio companies as of 31 December 2024 is based on data from PitchBook. Debt issuance data for the United States and European high-yield bond markets and leveraged loan markets as of 31 December 2024 is based on information from PitchBook. Certain adjustments to source data have been made to align with PwC’s industry mapping. All dollar amounts are in US dollars. Megadeals are defined as deals greater than $5bn in value.

2025 Outlook
Brian  Levy
Global Deals Industries Leader, PwC United States
The global M&A markets may finally be back on an upward trajectory as some of the economic and geopolitical uncertainties weighing on the market over the past couple of years lift. But will 2025 be a great M&A year or just another so-so one? Recent dealmaking momentum at the top end of the market suggests the upswing has already begun: the volume of deals greater than $1bn in value increased by 17% in 2024, and their average value rose. But we are also seeing some mixed signals: the volume of smaller and mid-sized deals fell by a meaningful 18% in 2024, and in the year ahead, dealmakers will need to keep their eye on some wild cards.
Deals that exceed $1bn only made up a sliver (about 1%) of the approximately 50,000 M&A deals announced globally last year, but these larger transactions often have an impact that goes beyond the actual acquisition in question. They set the tone for the whole market and grab the headlines. Executives seeing large deals happening around their industries often start to gain confidence to move forward more aggressively with their own M&A plans to stay competitive and for fear of missing out.
Several factors underlie the new-found M&A momentum. They include an intense CEO focus on growth and transformation in this new era of AI, greater capital availability, and an increased supply of assets expected to come to market—both private equity (PE) portfolio companies and non-core assets being divested by corporates. Nonetheless, dealmakers can’t ignore the wild cards, which include:
Volatile and uncertain geopolitics.Dealmakers and markets are still digesting the outcomes of the elections that took place in many countries during 2024 and the resulting changes to policy direction; in particular, the impact of the new Trump administration in the US as his policies and recent presidential executive orders, reverberate across the globe. Dealmakers should expect the unexpected.
Long-term interest rates are rising again.Inflation has continued to moderate, and central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have reduced interest rates in recent months. However, the momentum behind rate cuts has slowed, and with long-term interest rates rising in the US and elsewhere, this could make returns harder to find and lead to more challenging refinancing processes.
Valuations are high in some countries.In mid-January 2025, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for US stocks (based on the S&P 500) was 22.87, compared with 13.67 for non-US international stocks (based on the S&P International 700). Companies with higher valuations may use their stock as part of an inorganic growth strategy. We may also see more cross-border deals as US companies, buoyed by a strong US dollar, seek opportunities overseas, particularly in Europe.
‘An M&A recovery is overdue, but it may struggle to maintain its recent momentum at a time when long-term interest rates are rising and valuations are high. It’s a market that will distinguish top dealmakers from the rest. To be successful, they will need deep industry expertise and a laser focus on value.’
Several major global economies, such as Canada, France, Germany, and South Korea are facing political instability, and many have national elections in 2025. The impact of the Russia–Ukraine war, the potential calming of the conflict in the Middle East, and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria are events that also have a significant economic impact on the countries involved and their neighbours. We also can’t ignore the role of China on the geopolitical stage, given its position as the world’s second-largest economy and heightened political tensions in its relations with several countries.
The impact of the US election, in particular, is reverberating around the world, and the new administration’s policies may have significant—but at times contradictory—implications for M&A, not only in the US but also globally.
If the new US administration pushes through an agenda that is strong on deregulation and preserves or extends tax cuts, this could give a boost to growth and remove some barriers to dealmaking. However, we caution that sensitive areas that underlie national security, or deals involving access to large data pools, could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and will remain challenging.
A round of protectionist measures, including the imposition of tariffs, combined with potential retaliatory measures by other countries, could spark inflation and lead to increases in interest rates.
Trump has campaigned on a range of issues that could play out for M&A in different ways by sector, with any meaningful change serving as a catalyst for deals. For example:
Manufacturing, construction, agriculture, retail and healthcare.Policies to limit immigration might create labour shortages and spark inflation in these and other sectors. The imposition of tariffs may cause significant disruptions to supply chains for US multinationals that import goods into the country and may also create disruption for those exporting products if retaliatory action is taken.
Defence.Trump campaigned on a promise to end the wars in Russia–Ukraine and the Middle East. Although there is hope these conflicts will end this year, global defence spending is expected to continue. Focus areas may shift driven by the broader geopolitical landscape and potential for future conflicts but we expect strong defence budgets for at least the next ten years.
Energy production.A focus by the new US administration on increasing domestic oil and natural gas production will likely be a positive for the US energy sector. Despite uncertainties such as changes to the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy credits, renewable energy is expected to continue to benefit from long-term support for energy transition and AI’s growing demand for power.
Healthcare and pharma.Policy changes from the new Trump administration are expected to focus on disease prevention and personalised care, which will continue to spur innovation in the biopharmaceutical and healthcare sectors in the US. Although deregulation may benefit M&A in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, the potential threat of tariffs and impacts to global pharmaceutical supply chains will be important to monitor going forward.
Telecommunications.Trump’s appointed Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman, Brendan Carr, has supported satellite initiatives and historically voted against telecom regulation. This may create a more favourable environment for transactions and prompt consolidation in the private satellite and telecoms sectors.
Technology.After taking office, among other actions, Trump has reversed former president Biden’s executive order on AI safety standards and announced a $500bn joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank that aims to build a network of data centres across the US. Software companies may benefit from a less stringent stance from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), paving the way for more megadeal activity. However, the big tech and social media sectors may continue to face challenges, including calls for the biggest players to be broken up.
Successful dealmakers will be those who show an ability to navigate geopolitical issues rather than see them as obstacles. Investment decisions may ‘risk-off’ certain countries or favour others that align with trade alliances. Board and investment committee concerns will require dealmakers to factor geopolitics into their due diligence processes, which may add yet another important dimension to deal scorecards.
Regardless of which policies thenew Trump administrationenacts, dealmakers both in the US and internationally will need to be mindful of any transactions that involve strategic US technology or infrastructure or that could involve ownership of personal data of Americans. In other words, they will need to scrutinise deal ideas with a national security mindset, just as Trump and his team would.
The US Federal Reserve’s rate cuts in 2024, along with similar rate cuts by other central banks (including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England), have helped fuel the new M&A momentum to date. In the US, rates were cut by 100 basis points between September and December 2024. However, long-term rates have increased: the yield on a ten-year US Treasury note rose to just under 5% in early January. Long-term rates have also increased in the UK and other countries. This creates greater uncertainty regarding the timing and degree of future rate cuts in 2025. Further cuts will depend on the strength of the local economy and whether inflation continues to cool. Higher rates and slowing growth make deal economics more challenging.
Even though long-term rates have moved higher, yields in the leveraged loan market fell during 2024, largely because of growing competition between private credit and banks returning to the lending market. In 2024, lending by banks increased in the investment-grade debt market, high-yield bond market and leveraged loan market. Debt issuance in the US and European high-yield bond markets reached $388bn in 2024, up 74% from 2023. US and European leveraged loan market issuances more than doubled to $770bn in 2024. This greater capital availability helps provide the fuel for M&A.
The growing private credit market—which now has almost $1.7tn under management —has attracted its own wave of dealmaking. Many PE funds have acquired private credit firms to capitalise on the market’s growth potential. In September 2024, Brookfield made a $1.5bn strategic investment in Castlelake, an alternatives asset manager specialising in asset-based private credit; in December 2024, BlackRock announced its proposed acquisition of HPS Investment Partners—a firm that specialises in both private and public credit—for approximately $12bn.
As private credit lending has risen, unsurprisingly, the number of restructurings involving private credit has also gone up. In these situations, companies and their lenders engage in a process of renegotiating, restructuring or modifying the company’s debt obligations to improve financial stability and address distress. While the fundamental restructuring principles remain unchanged irrespective of the lender, the strong relationships between PE sponsors and private credit firms often lead to consensual solutions. Consensual measures include voluntary debt-equity exchanges or refinancings, whereas non-consensual ones include court-mandated restructurings and ‘cramdowns’—where terms are imposed on dissenting creditors or on shareholders to achieve a viable outcome. We expect that in 2025, there will be a continuation of the trend seen in 2024, in which there was an increase in the number of international restructurings, particularly in countries such as the US, UK, Netherlands, Brazil, and Singapore.
The new competition between banks and private credit has not only created a strong supply of capital for dealmaking but has also helped push down financing costs. However, the days of near-zero interest rates have gone, and while a lower cost of capital is good news for dealmakers, it remains elevated compared with levels of the past decade. To achieve the desired rates of return in an environment with higher interest rates, dealmakers need to apply an unrelenting focus on value creation. In a distress situation, early conversations between the company and its lenders will increase the likelihood of a consensual restructuring.
Three key trends in today’s market are intensifying and we believe they will heighten the deals imperative, leading to more M&A activity in 2025. First, companies are focused on growth and transformation; second, AI is acting as a catalyst for change and reinvention; and third, PE players are under increasing pressure to exit mature portfolio company investments.
According to PwC’s 28th Annual Global CEO Survey, published in January 2025, only 38% of CEOs were ‘extremely’ or ‘very’ confident about their company’s prospects for revenue growth over the next 12 months. That figure increased to 53% when respondents were asked about their company’s prospects over a three-year horizon. This suggests CEOs expect that current actions or future planned actions will lead to further growth of their company’s top line. This is especially important in an economic environment with slowing growth, in which many companies are finding organic revenue growth much harder to achieve.
M&A as a growth strategy
M&A continues to be an essential strategic element in helping companies shape their future, transform their business models and generate growth. Companies need to systematically review and rethink their value chains, distribution channels, customer communications, technology platforms and all other aspects of their operations to identify new ways of doing business to stay relevant, particularly in an environment that is being disrupted broadly by technology, specifically by AI, and universally by other global megatrends.
We expect that dealmaking activity will include acquisitions focused on both revenue and margin growth, with the intent of accessing new markets, enhancing capabilities and improving operational efficiencies. Given the significant costs of investing in technology and AI, the advantage goes to larger companies that have the investment capacity. We are also seeing a similar trend in highly regulated sectors such as banking and insurance, in which deals aimed at increasing scale can help spread anticipated cost increases associated with regulatory compliance across a wider customer base.
Divestitures to drive business transformation
Another trend we expect to see more of in 2025 is the refining of corporate portfolios as companies look to fill capability gaps and divest non-core or low-growth assets. In sectors including the industrials, consumer health and entertainment, among others, large corporates have been separating themselves from non-core business, either through spin-offs or sales. Recent examples include GE’s split into three public companies; Sanofi’s decision to transfer a controlling stake in its consumer health business, Opella, to CD&R, and Comcast’s plan to spin off its NBCUniversal cable TV networks, along with complementary digital assets.

Another factor that could significantly affect M&A is how the AI wave plays out at a company and market level as a catalyst for change and reinvention. For now, market expectations for AI and its potentially transformational capabilities are sky high, with about half of CEOs in our latest survey expecting GenAI to increase their company’s profitability in the year ahead. However, it's worth noting that actual performance is somewhat below CEO expectations expressed in last year's survey. In 2024, 46% said they expected to see profitability improvements. A year later, when asked if they had seen those gains, only 34% said they had.
Despite this, the conviction about the technology’s disruptive power continues—and as outcomes improve, we expect this to create M&A tailwinds, not only in the technology sector but across all sectors. Companies around the world are accelerating their transformations to adopt AI at scale, with the aim of creating greater efficiencies and new revenue opportunities, partnerships and processes. Those that figure out how to harness the power of AI may be able to turn it into a deal-making advantage.
AI is supercharging investments and attracting trillions of dollars in capital
AI is not only attracting investment in AI companies but also has supercharged investment in the digital infrastructure required to support it, including data centres and power generation capabilities. Capital expenditures of as much as $2tn are expected over the next five years to build and facilitate new data centres in the US and globally. The investment for now is predominantly taking the form of direct investments or partnerships versus traditional M&A.
ThisAI-led capital expenditure ‘super cycle’will likely affect M&A in two ways: first, there could be a crowding out of M&A as investor allocations shift from a strategy of ‘buy’ (via M&A) to one of ‘build’ (via capital expenditures, partnerships and strategic alliances); second, we expect to see more opportunities to capture market share and value by making strategic acquisitions of companies or assets that are positioned within the AI value chain.
Examples of investments in data centres and digital infrastructure include the following: DigitalBridge and Silver Lake’s $9.2bn equity investment in Vantage Data Centers, completed in June 2024; the AI partnership between BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft and a leading AI investor from the Middle East, announced in September 2024, to fund up to $100bn; Blackstone’s $16bn acquisition of AirTrunk, completed in December 2024; and the ‘Stargate’ joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle, announced in January 2025, to fund up to $500bn.
One example of an investment in power generation is Microsoft’s September 2024 signing of a power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to restart Crane Clean Energy Center (formerly Unit 1 of Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Station); another example is Google’s announcement in December 2024 of a new partnership with clean energy developer Intersect Power and with TPG, which plans to invest $20bn in renewable power infrastructure by 2030 to enable the buildout of new data centre capacity in the US, powered by clean energy.
These investments in data centres, digital infrastructure and power generation are emblematic of changes in the business landscape related to themes or domains of activity. These domains of activity are creating cross-sector dependencies that are leading to new business models, partnerships and avenues for growth, all of which are likely to boost further opportunities for dealmaking.
Over the past three years, below-average levels of PE exits have resulted in rising average holding periods for PE portfolio companies. We anticipate more PE-backed companies coming to the market in 2025 due to mounting pressure from limited partners on PE firms to exit these older investments. PitchBook data indicates that nearly half of the 29,400 PE portfolio companies worldwide have been held since 2020.
Deal values increased 5% between 2023 and 2024, whereas deal volumes decreased by 17% over the same period. Regional trends were similar to global, but varied at a country level. In the Americas, deal values in the US grew 6%; in EMEA, several megadeals in the UK led to an increase in deal values for the country—in contrast to many other European countries where deal values declined; and in Asia Pacific, Japan and India performed strongly with 24% and 20% increases in deal values, respectively. In terms of deal volumes, each region experienced a decline compared to 2023.

More $1bn plus deals.The number of deals valued at greater than $1bn increased from 430 in 2023 to more than 500 in 2024. This has boosted average deal sizes by 11%, to $146m in 2024. The number of small to mid-sized deals is still languishing, partly because of continuing valuation gaps between buyers and sellers and a challenging PE market.
Behind this upward trend in deals of more than $1bn are corporate dealmakers—some of them having been able to use their companies’ highly valued stock as currency—and top PE funds that are looking for larger deals as they raise historic amounts of capital.

Megadeals activity expands.Of the 502 deals in 2024 valued greater than $1bn, 72 were megadeals (deals greater than $5bn), compared to only 61 in 2023. In early 2024, most megadeal activity was in the technology, energy and banking sectors. However, in the second half of the year, we saw a broadening out into other sectors. In the second half of 2024, although technology remained in first place, insurance climbed to second place and media and entertainment came in third place.
In 2024, each of the top three deals was in a different sector: in retail, Couche-Tard’s $39bn offer to acquire Seven & i Holdings Co (known for its 7-Eleven franchise); in banking, Capital One’s proposed $35.3bn acquisition of Discover Financial Services; and in software, Synopsys’ proposed $32.5bn acquisition of Ansys.
Deal values increase in many sectors.Several sectors had higher deal values in 2024 than in 2023, with entertainment and media, technology, and aerospace and defence, as well as the financial services sectors of banking, insurance and asset and wealth management all having some notable megadeals. Deal values in the pharma and life sciences sector decreased by 36% in 2024 because of a drop in the number of megadeals (from ten in 2023 to four in 2024). Deal values also decreased in the oil and gas sector because of two deals worth more than $50bn each announced in 2023.
Deal volumes declined across all sectors.Every sector saw a decrease in deal volumes between 2023 and 2024, although the decreases varied from -2% for the mining sector to -27% in the technology sector.
‘We are seeing the long-awaited recovery in M&A broadening out to more sectors and more countries and with more large deals. All of this is giving “legs” to the momentum that started already in 2024, but the potential for surprises, both good and bad, remains high. Dealmakers will need to keep a close eye on valuations, interest rates and geopolitics in the year ahead.’
One of the latest M&A developments—and one which looks set to become a broader trend—is the growing convergence among sectors around particular themes. AI infrastructure is a case in point: the huge amount of computing power AI needs to process reams of data in a very short time requires a tidal wave of investment info semiconductors, data centers, and digital infrastructure. As a result, for the first time in decades demand is outstripping our energy capacity. Accordingly, the past few months have seen deals bringing together tech companies with energy providers and real estate players to build data centers and other major new digital infrastructure. EXAMPLES We are seeing record new capital formation through partnerships with players that had preciously not tied themselves together from big tech – the Mag 7, sovereign wealth funds, traditional PR and infrastructure. The investment needs over the next few years could easily be in over a trillion US dollars This has supercharged deals in the digital infrastructure space igniting a fire under data centers and interestingly, these deals don’t resemble traditional M&A – they have been more akin to growth capital transactions, but on a scale creating billions in investments and partnerships. We expect these new era growth capital deals to continue to proliferate in energy and data centers, in particular. However, we pause to question whether this massive capital spend will mean that big tech companies, PE and others allocate less to M&A transactions, in what would amount to a crowding out of deals as “build” replaces “buy”.
The rise of AI plays into another major theme that will fuel M&A in 2025: corporate transformations and business model reinvention. As the AI infrastructure absorbs the capital at a record pace the onus shifts to companies across every industry to invest in leveraging AI to reinvent themselves – through the greatest catalyst in history to disrupt, reinvent, innovate and create new revenue opportunities, new partnerships, new processes and reduce costs. These have long been an essential driver of M&A activity and many global companies have announced carve-outs and disposals of some assets they deem non-core in order to refine and narrow their strategic focus. AI will act as a spur to this corporate refocusing. It promises greater growth and productivity, but also require new skills, capabilities, corporate structures, and cultures. Acquisitions can help laggards get up to speed faster, but, beyond that, a judgement of the AI readiness of potential target companies will become a necessity: dealmakers will need to build a case around how AI will or won’t affect every new deal, and we expect the thesis to state that it will impact the deal and therefore dealmakers will be forced to scenario plan and understand the sensitivities of returns.
Capital availability and interest rates will be a third major driver of M&A in 2025. Yields in the leveraged loan market in the US have come down in the back half of this year, even though the rates for 10-year Treasury notes have risen. That is largely the result of growing competition between private credit —who now have almost $1.9 trillion under management—and banks returning to the lending market. Private credit shows no sign of slowing its growth. The end result is a good one for dealmakers, because it means that ever more capital is available at even more competitive prices, at a time when interest rates appear to have stabilized and may have further to fall. We note that despite cooling inflation the market remains concerned about getting inflation to the 2% target, and the US Fed just shifted its rate expectations to only 2 cuts vs four for 2025. If inflation creeps back in the market will not react kindly.
Finally, politics will be a wild card for M&A. For his second term as US President, Donald Trump is promising large-scale deregulation, a more favourable tax regime, the threat if not promise of tariffs, and a public-sector transformation initiative of its own focused on eliminating regulations, efficiency and cost-savings led by two entrepreneurs, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Even before his inauguration, key appointments to US regulatory agencies suggested a less interventionist touch in overseeing mergers and acquisition than under the Biden Administration. Yet questions remain about how far any deregulation or tax cuts could go—and whether their effect on the US and global economy would be offset by protectionist moves including tariffs on imported goods and services that could crimp growth and stoke inflation. The geopolitical world seems to have hopes of more stability and peace but there are unlimited examples of new challenges that have already cropped up including destabilization and no confidence votes in many countries such as Canada, South Korea, France and Germany and others like Syria where rebels have overthrown long standing regimes, all further clouding the geopolitical skies, without mentioning the ongoing wars. If the Trump effect is already having such far reaching implications across the world before his inauguration, what will happen on Jan 21st?
CEO confidence has improved post election. Importantly, the outright contrast between the Trump administration and its pro business fundamentals versus the restrictive policies of the prior government are duly noted. We expect major changes in key industries such as healthcare, pharma and food as the Make America Healthy Again mantra promoted by RFK Jr and his nomination as secretary of Health and Human Services. Additionally, defense, aerospace and industries selling to the government will be put under pressure as the aforementioned DOGE embarks on its mission. Technology and social media will likewise face challenges as calls for breaking up these powerhouses continue and the impact of the Tik Tok ban (or its reversal) loom large. These are just a few industries that will be in the crosshairs of the new administration and any changes could be a catalyst for M&A, particularly in the back half of 2025.
To be successful, dealmakers will need to be prepared to answer some tough questions, including the following:
How could AI affect the business model of the company you plan to acquire? This will require critical analysis and scenario planning, including factoring in the cost of enabling AI at the target or acquiring company.
In a market with robust valuations and slowing economic growth in some countries, how can returns meet expectations? This will require making value creation a priority and building accountability frameworks.
What alternative options exist in the event of a failed refinancing or a difficult, delayed or halted M&A process due to the debt surpassing the company’s enterprise value? In such situations, dealmakers will need to develop a plan B, or even a plan C.
Where in the world are there still opportunities for investors? Cross-border opportunities may become more challenging, but the risk may be worth the reward with thoughtful linkage between corporate strategy, deal thesis and country geopolitical risk assessment.
What are the geopolitical implications, including for national security, of any deal being considered? Careful scenario planning, including creating a framework of corporate agility and strong contingency plans, will pay dividends.
These are indeed complicated times for the M&A markets. So much seems to be in place for a resurgence of dealmaking on both the buy side and the sell side. Yet some important aspects, from valuations and interest rates to geopolitics, create pressure that can’t easily be brushed aside. Market expectations for an M&A rebound have disappointed over the past two years, and there are no guarantees that this new dawn for M&A in 2025 won’t prove to be another false dawn. Yet this time, many more of the stars are aligned. If the large deal activity continues, in a market like this, momentum can quickly become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The stakes are high, and the trajectory may well not be linear, but we are confident that the momentum for M&A in 2025 will be there, particularly in the second half. But will it be enough to make M&A great again? We surely hope so—and financial markets are counting on it.
Our commentary on M&A trends is based on data from industry-recognised sources and our own independent research. Specifically, deal volumes and values referenced in this publication are based on officially announced transactions, excluding rumoured and withdrawn transactions, as provided by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as of 31 December 2024 and accessed between 6-9 January 2025. The number of PE portfolio companies as of 31 December 2024 is based on data from PitchBook. Debt issuance data for the United States and European high-yield bond markets and leveraged loan markets as of 31 December 2024 is based on information from PitchBook. Certain adjustments to source data have been made to align with PwC’s industry mapping. All dollar amounts are in US dollars. Megadeals are defined as deals greater than $5bn in value.

2025 Outlook

Global Real Estate Deals Leader, PwC United States
Real estate dealmakers are cautiously optimistic about 2025 and eager to get deals done. Against the backdrop of a global real estate deals environment that is evolving—in response to changes in interest rates, anticipated shifts in trade policies and broadening capital sources, among other factors—global capital flows and investors’ return expectations and capital allocation strategies are also evolving. As a result, we believe investors will continue to expand into alternative asset classes and look for creative financing solutions to achieve returns that exceed established standards and benchmarks.
Traditional real estate asset classes—office, retail, industrial and multifamily—will continue to receive capital and see deal activity where it makes sense. But we see returns in alternative asset classes in the real estate ecosystem as more attractive than traditional asset classes on a risk-adjusted basis. These alternatives include variations on traditional asset classes that are influenced by how users interact with their built environment. Examples include mixed-use developments adjacent to sports venues and manufacturing facilities, as well as retail spaces that are transformed into mixed-use developments with age-restricted housing. Some of the alternatives are tied to digitalisation, deglobalisation or demographics, among other factors. This includes the wellness trend, which we spotlight further below.
‘Alongside the traditional real estate asset classes, we are seeing a surge in new alternative investment possibilities that provide higher returns. I think these will become increasingly important to dealmakers and the investment community in 2025 and beyond.’
Deal volume (that is, the number of announced property transactions) in 2025 is expected to outpace recent transaction volume because of increased certainty in the market and the broadening of investible real estate asset classes—an expectation that recent quarterly trends support. In the first quarter of 2024, global real estate deal values for traditional real estate asset classes were $217bn, the lowest level in over a decade. Central banks’ sharp increases of interest rates starting in 2022, after years of near-zero rates, sent real estate values tumbling from their peak of $840bn in the fourth quarter of 2021—a year which saw global M&A reach record levels driven by the pandemic. However, by the third quarter of 2024, deal values for traditional real estate asset classes started to rise again, reaching $253bn, indicating that the real estate M&A market may have bottomed out. Deal volumes nonetheless remained subdued: in the first nine months of 2024, the number of transactions averaged 7,649 per quarter, a 4% decline compared to 7,982 per quarter the prior year.
Central banks have created greater certainty for lenders and investors as they have switched to a rate-cutting mode, and we expect an upward trend in deals throughout 2025 on the back of this movement, alongside the continued push into alternative asset classes. Regression analyses undertaken by leading investment banks, such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and alternative asset managers, such as KKR, indicate that double-digit increases are likely.
Uncertainties that could affect M&A activity persist, however, tempering our optimism. These include a complex geopolitical environment—with elections in 2025 in a number of countries and anticipated changes to influential US public policies on issues such as trade, immigration and taxes following the re-election of Donald Trump—along with continued economic strength in the US and other parts of the world. If significant tariffs are imposed and lead to retaliation, this may result in a higher inflationary environment and a stronger US dollar and potentially affect interest rate easing by central banks, putting pressure on underwritten returns and investor confidence.
Investors seeking to broaden their portfolios are identifying and capitalising on emerging asset classes. One example is wellness-related real estate. We expect increasing investor interest in this subsector in response to demographic changes and evolving consumer preferences. According to the Global Wellness Institute, the wellness-related real estate subsector is expected to grow at a 15.8% CAGR over the next three years and exceed $900bn in value by 2028. This will have implications for the entire commercial and residential real estate industry. Given the close ties between wellness and consumer preferences and the desire for enhanced experiences, this wellness trend is especially relevant in the residential, hospitality and leisure sectors.
An immediate indication of the enduring characteristics of this theme is the growth in wellness-oriented residential sectors, especially in senior housing. It’s no longer enough to simply have suitable accommodation—consumers are increasingly seeking high-quality living environments with design elements that promote holistic wellbeing and encourage social interaction.
The focus on wellness within the hospitality sector has already begun to grow. The hotel and travel industries are experiencing a robust increase in wellness-oriented services, with luxury wellness retreats leading the trend.
In the post-pandemic environment, consumer and industry awareness of how external environments can affect physical and mental wellbeing is driving demand for these retreats. For example, Therme Group, a developer of wellbeing resorts, plans to expand further in Europe as well as in the UK, North America, Asia and the Middle East. In December 2024, Therme announced the acquisition of Therme Erding, a wellbeing destination in Germany. The Well, a New York-based wellness club, partnered with hospitality group Auberge Resorts Collection to add wellness spaces to some of Auberge’s global locations. And the Maybourne Hotel Group has partnered with two prominent wellness experts to create an exclusive wellness offering.
As the wellness sector continues to evolve, we expect it to attract substantial investor interest and present opportunities for those looking to diversify their investment portfolios. The sector’s alignment with long-term demographic and health trends ensures its prominence in future investment strategies. Investors may want to focus closely on this theme.
According to the United Nations, the global over-80 population is projected to almost triple  from 163 million today to 445 million by 2050. In response to this demographic change, there is increased demand for housing across the care spectrum, from nursing homes to independent living communities. However, there is a global imbalance between this demand and the available supply of senior housing. This gap is primarily due to hesitancy among developers to commit to projects because of challenges such as limited access to affordable financing, local labour shortages and rapidly rising construction costs. Additionally, the diverse preferences and lifestyles within the ageing population require the industry to offer a range of housing options and quickly adapt to emerging trends, including the wellness trend discussed earlier.
To address these challenges, investors, developers and operators are creating innovative capital structures, operational models and projects that enable users to maintain the lifestyle they have been accustomed to while being able to access more care if needed. Strategies range from retrofitting existing apartment buildings to make units senior-friendly and leasing them on a multi-year basis, to transforming retail spaces into mixed-use developments with age-restricted housing. Senior housing assets will need to be outfitted with the appropriate equipment and amenities. These include features such as accessibility, safety and proximity to medical services. Senior housing will also need to respond to a growing preference in some regions for ‘ageing in place’, in which older adults are able to continue to live safely, independently and comfortably in their own home and community.
Success in this sector requires developers, capital partners and operators to embrace innovation and strategic positioning. By aligning closely with consumer preferences and leveraging real estate market trends, they can effectively capitalise on opportunities in the senior housing market.
We have begun to see announcements of US transactions involving the nascent trend of senior housing portfolios being acquired by public real estate investment trusts. We are also seeing strategic repositioning by non-traditional senior-housing market participants as they evaluate how to evolve their business models to capitalise on this trend and remain responsive to changing consumer preferences. Examples of M&A activity include Welltower’s acquisition of a portfolio of adult communities in February 2024 and Ventas’ acquisition of a 20-asset senior housing portfolio in November 2024. To unlock value and take advantage of demographic trends, investors will need to find developers who can meet the wellness and experiential demands of potential tenants and find financing sources willing to originate creative capital structures.
of respondents said the residential sector is likely the one in which they will be active or plan to be active in Asia Pacific in 2025.
After several tough years marked by an unpredictable interest rate environment, M&A in real estate showed signs of stabilising in mid-2024 amid easing interest rates and improved deal economics for many. Although the first quarter of 2024 saw a ten-year low in terms of deal values, by the third quarter of 2024 there were signs of recovery—but not enough to make up for the first half of the year. As a result, global deal values declined by 13% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same prior year period.
Trends in deal values varied by region. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), deal values increased by a modest 2% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. By contrast, deal values in the Americas and Asia-Pacific declined by 1% and 24%, respectively, over the same period.
Asia-Pacific dominated in terms of overall deal values, with $325bn (46%) of deals announced in the first nine months of 2024, compared to $250bn (35%) in the Americas and $138bn (19%) in EMEA. Because real estate is heavily influenced by local market conditions, trends often vary significantly across countries in a region and even across towns and cities within the same country. For example, in South Korea and Australia, 2024 volumes increased by 25% and 14%, respectively, in response to changes in interest rates and increased confidence from institutional investors, while deal volumes in Japan and China declined by 9% and 5%, respectively. In Europe, volume was significantly affected by the perceived risk from political volatility, especially in Germany and France, where deal volumes declined by 8% and 35%, respectively.
of real estate investors expect their firm’s profit to be ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ in 2025—20 percentage points higher than last year.

Infrastructure has displayed an impressive growth trajectory over the past decade, making it an especially attractive asset class. New ways in which investors and users interact with the built environment are leading to a convergence of real estate and infrastructure dealmaking, a relationship that the World Economic Forum described as reciprocal in their December 2024Reimagining Real Estatepublication. AI for example is attracting investment not just in AI companies, but also significantly in the data centres, digital infrastructure and power generation capabilities required to support it. The investment needs in the digital infrastructure space havesupercharged deals activity in data centres, but investor interest also extends to traditional infrastructure, other digital-related assets such as fibre and towers, and assets tied to shifting supply chains such as manufacturing facilities.
Deal structuring, financing and operations have evolved to facilitate this convergence. Investors are seeking opportunities to develop and operate their own facilities, which often take the form of co-investments with limited partners, or to create joint ventures with established operators. These typically involve a co-investment component in which the investor acts solely as a capital provider. For example, in March 2024 Digital Realty and Mitsubishi Corporation announced a joint venture focused on developing data centres. Digital Realty has been using a strategy of acquisitions and joint ventures to scale capacity and expand its platform into new markets across the world.
The nature of infrastructure deals, including the significant investment required, necessitates a sophisticated approach to financing which leverages different types of capital at different stages of the project. For example, opportunistic capital may be used during the development phase, after which stabilised assets might be sold to a different vehicle with a core strategy, or possibly (following the US model) as asset-backed securities.
Previously, investors were reliant on market changes to create returns, but now they are actively managing their investments and identifying opportunities to supplement their real-asset portfolios with operational expertise. In this increasingly competitive investment market, to achieve desired returns, investors need a sophisticated approach to financing and identifying the appropriate operational teams and partners. These dynamics illustrate just how quickly the real estate industry is evolving. And it highlights the importance of real estate to the functioning of the global economy.
was the value of global real estate in 2022—more than all equities and debt securities combined—making real estate the world’s most significant store of wealth.

The insurance sector has been playing an increasingly important role as an alternative source of capital as investor fund allocations shift from real estate assets to infrastructure and other asset classes. Private capital players have entered the insurance sector through acquisitions or strategic relationships. Examples include Apollo’s investment in Athene and KKR’s acquisition of Global Atlantic, both of which have continued to scale rapidly, along with similar financial vehicles sponsored by others, such as Blackstone and Brookfield. These vehicles were created as a way for private capital firms to access long-term capital at a time when higher interest rates put pressure on returns. Essentially, they unlocked new lending capabilities at a more favourable cost of capital.
These relationships with insurance companies are critically important for the real estate industry at a time in which some traditional financing sources have reduced their allocations to the industry. However, the insurance capital dynamic is broader than this. Some market participants believe owning assets within insurance companies creates more value than owning them in traditional real estate structures, and they have restructured the ownership of portfolios in response—in some cases, concluding that they should run a global real estate investment business moving forward.
All of this goes to show just how complex the operating environment is, how industry sectors continue to converge and how important real estate is to market participants. We expect to see more activity in this space as it continues to have a material impact on the real estate industry.
Over the past decade, some companies with significant real estate assets have elected to change the ownership structure of their businesses for the purpose of improving capital efficiency and increasing enterprise value. We have begun to see this trend in other sectors, as companies shift from asset- and capital-intensive balance sheets to asset-light operations.
Early movers included hospitality brands such as Hilton and La Quinta who spun off owned hotel assets into separate public hotel real estate investment trusts. Others, such as Wyndham and Marriott, separated their hotel and timeshare assets into separate companies though spin-offs. Meanwhile, gaming operators such as VICI Properties and Gaming and Leisure Properties spun off their owned casino assets into separate publicly traded gaming real estate investment trusts.
Looking forward, other sectors that we expect to pursue this path include wellness industry operators, renewable energy manufacturers, technology companies and consumer brands. Private equity, sovereign wealth funds and foreign pension funds can serve as an ‘off-ramp’ for these assets and create long-term investment opportunities which capitalise on macroeconomic and demographic trends.
In 2025, we expect to see a rise in real estate M&A activity driven by favourable economic conditions, lower interest rates and available capital. This growth may be tempered by global trade and other uncertainties. At the same time, we note the rise of a number of alternative asset classes which yield higher returns. Successful dealmakers will navigate this evolving landscape adeptly and employ advanced strategies to structure and finance deals with the right partners.

2025 Outlook

Global Real Estate Deals Leader, PwC United States
Real estate dealmakers are cautiously optimistic about 2025 and eager to get deals done. Against the backdrop of a global real estate deals environment that is evolving—in response to changes in interest rates, anticipated shifts in trade policies and broadening capital sources, among other factors—global capital flows and investors’ return expectations and capital allocation strategies are also evolving. As a result, we believe investors will continue to expand into alternative asset classes and look for creative financing solutions to achieve returns that exceed established standards and benchmarks.
Traditional real estate asset classes—office, retail, industrial and multifamily—will continue to receive capital and see deal activity where it makes sense. But we see returns in alternative asset classes in the real estate ecosystem as more attractive than traditional asset classes on a risk-adjusted basis. These alternatives include variations on traditional asset classes that are influenced by how users interact with their built environment. Examples include mixed-use developments adjacent to sports venues and manufacturing facilities, as well as retail spaces that are transformed into mixed-use developments with age-restricted housing. Some of the alternatives are tied to digitalisation, deglobalisation or demographics, among other factors. This includes the wellness trend, which we spotlight further below.
‘Alongside the traditional real estate asset classes, we are seeing a surge in new alternative investment possibilities that provide higher returns. I think these will become increasingly important to dealmakers and the investment community in 2025 and beyond.’
Deal volume (that is, the number of announced property transactions) in 2025 is expected to outpace recent transaction volume because of increased certainty in the market and the broadening of investible real estate asset classes—an expectation that recent quarterly trends support. In the first quarter of 2024, global real estate deal values for traditional real estate asset classes were $217bn, the lowest level in over a decade. Central banks’ sharp increases of interest rates starting in 2022, after years of near-zero rates, sent real estate values tumbling from their peak of $840bn in the fourth quarter of 2021—a year which saw global M&A reach record levels driven by the pandemic. However, by the third quarter of 2024, deal values for traditional real estate asset classes started to rise again, reaching $253bn, indicating that the real estate M&A market may have bottomed out. Deal volumes nonetheless remained subdued: in the first nine months of 2024, the number of transactions averaged 7,649 per quarter, a 4% decline compared to 7,982 per quarter the prior year.
Central banks have created greater certainty for lenders and investors as they have switched to a rate-cutting mode, and we expect an upward trend in deals throughout 2025 on the back of this movement, alongside the continued push into alternative asset classes. Regression analyses undertaken by leading investment banks, such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and alternative asset managers, such as KKR, indicate that double-digit increases are likely.
Uncertainties that could affect M&A activity persist, however, tempering our optimism. These include a complex geopolitical environment—with elections in 2025 in a number of countries and anticipated changes to influential US public policies on issues such as trade, immigration and taxes following the re-election of Donald Trump—along with continued economic strength in the US and other parts of the world. If significant tariffs are imposed and lead to retaliation, this may result in a higher inflationary environment and a stronger US dollar and potentially affect interest rate easing by central banks, putting pressure on underwritten returns and investor confidence.
Investors seeking to broaden their portfolios are identifying and capitalising on emerging asset classes. One example is wellness-related real estate. We expect increasing investor interest in this subsector in response to demographic changes and evolving consumer preferences. According to the Global Wellness Institute, the wellness-related real estate subsector is expected to grow at a 15.8% CAGR over the next three years and exceed $900bn in value by 2028. This will have implications for the entire commercial and residential real estate industry. Given the close ties between wellness and consumer preferences and the desire for enhanced experiences, this wellness trend is especially relevant in the residential, hospitality and leisure sectors.
An immediate indication of the enduring characteristics of this theme is the growth in wellness-oriented residential sectors, especially in senior housing. It’s no longer enough to simply have suitable accommodation—consumers are increasingly seeking high-quality living environments with design elements that promote holistic wellbeing and encourage social interaction.
The focus on wellness within the hospitality sector has already begun to grow. The hotel and travel industries are experiencing a robust increase in wellness-oriented services, with luxury wellness retreats leading the trend.
In the post-pandemic environment, consumer and industry awareness of how external environments can affect physical and mental wellbeing is driving demand for these retreats. For example, Therme Group, a developer of wellbeing resorts, plans to expand further in Europe as well as in the UK, North America, Asia and the Middle East. In December 2024, Therme announced the acquisition of Therme Erding, a wellbeing destination in Germany. The Well, a New York-based wellness club, partnered with hospitality group Auberge Resorts Collection to add wellness spaces to some of Auberge’s global locations. And the Maybourne Hotel Group has partnered with two prominent wellness experts to create an exclusive wellness offering.
As the wellness sector continues to evolve, we expect it to attract substantial investor interest and present opportunities for those looking to diversify their investment portfolios. The sector’s alignment with long-term demographic and health trends ensures its prominence in future investment strategies. Investors may want to focus closely on this theme.
According to the United Nations, the global over-80 population is projected to almost triple  from 163 million today to 445 million by 2050. In response to this demographic change, there is increased demand for housing across the care spectrum, from nursing homes to independent living communities. However, there is a global imbalance between this demand and the available supply of senior housing. This gap is primarily due to hesitancy among developers to commit to projects because of challenges such as limited access to affordable financing, local labour shortages and rapidly rising construction costs. Additionally, the diverse preferences and lifestyles within the ageing population require the industry to offer a range of housing options and quickly adapt to emerging trends, including the wellness trend discussed earlier.
To address these challenges, investors, developers and operators are creating innovative capital structures, operational models and projects that enable users to maintain the lifestyle they have been accustomed to while being able to access more care if needed. Strategies range from retrofitting existing apartment buildings to make units senior-friendly and leasing them on a multi-year basis, to transforming retail spaces into mixed-use developments with age-restricted housing. Senior housing assets will need to be outfitted with the appropriate equipment and amenities. These include features such as accessibility, safety and proximity to medical services. Senior housing will also need to respond to a growing preference in some regions for ‘ageing in place’, in which older adults are able to continue to live safely, independently and comfortably in their own home and community.
Success in this sector requires developers, capital partners and operators to embrace innovation and strategic positioning. By aligning closely with consumer preferences and leveraging real estate market trends, they can effectively capitalise on opportunities in the senior housing market.
We have begun to see announcements of US transactions involving the nascent trend of senior housing portfolios being acquired by public real estate investment trusts. We are also seeing strategic repositioning by non-traditional senior-housing market participants as they evaluate how to evolve their business models to capitalise on this trend and remain responsive to changing consumer preferences. Examples of M&A activity include Welltower’s acquisition of a portfolio of adult communities in February 2024 and Ventas’ acquisition of a 20-asset senior housing portfolio in November 2024. To unlock value and take advantage of demographic trends, investors will need to find developers who can meet the wellness and experiential demands of potential tenants and find financing sources willing to originate creative capital structures.
of respondents said the residential sector is likely the one in which they will be active or plan to be active in Asia Pacific in 2025.
After several tough years marked by an unpredictable interest rate environment, M&A in real estate showed signs of stabilising in mid-2024 amid easing interest rates and improved deal economics for many. Although the first quarter of 2024 saw a ten-year low in terms of deal values, by the third quarter of 2024 there were signs of recovery—but not enough to make up for the first half of the year. As a result, global deal values declined by 13% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same prior year period.
Trends in deal values varied by region. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), deal values increased by a modest 2% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. By contrast, deal values in the Americas and Asia-Pacific declined by 1% and 24%, respectively, over the same period.
Asia-Pacific dominated in terms of overall deal values, with $325bn (46%) of deals announced in the first nine months of 2024, compared to $250bn (35%) in the Americas and $138bn (19%) in EMEA. Because real estate is heavily influenced by local market conditions, trends often vary significantly across countries in a region and even across towns and cities within the same country. For example, in South Korea and Australia, 2024 volumes increased by 25% and 14%, respectively, in response to changes in interest rates and increased confidence from institutional investors, while deal volumes in Japan and China declined by 9% and 5%, respectively. In Europe, volume was significantly affected by the perceived risk from political volatility, especially in Germany and France, where deal volumes declined by 8% and 35%, respectively.
of real estate investors expect their firm’s profit to be ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ in 2025—20 percentage points higher than last year.

Infrastructure has displayed an impressive growth trajectory over the past decade, making it an especially attractive asset class. New ways in which investors and users interact with the built environment are leading to a convergence of real estate and infrastructure dealmaking, a relationship that the World Economic Forum described as reciprocal in their December 2024Reimagining Real Estatepublication. AI for example is attracting investment not just in AI companies, but also significantly in the data centres, digital infrastructure and power generation capabilities required to support it. The investment needs in the digital infrastructure space havesupercharged deals activity in data centres, but investor interest also extends to traditional infrastructure, other digital-related assets such as fibre and towers, and assets tied to shifting supply chains such as manufacturing facilities.
Deal structuring, financing and operations have evolved to facilitate this convergence. Investors are seeking opportunities to develop and operate their own facilities, which often take the form of co-investments with limited partners, or to create joint ventures with established operators. These typically involve a co-investment component in which the investor acts solely as a capital provider. For example, in March 2024 Digital Realty and Mitsubishi Corporation announced a joint venture focused on developing data centres. Digital Realty has been using a strategy of acquisitions and joint ventures to scale capacity and expand its platform into new markets across the world.
The nature of infrastructure deals, including the significant investment required, necessitates a sophisticated approach to financing which leverages different types of capital at different stages of the project. For example, opportunistic capital may be used during the development phase, after which stabilised assets might be sold to a different vehicle with a core strategy, or possibly (following the US model) as asset-backed securities.
Previously, investors were reliant on market changes to create returns, but now they are actively managing their investments and identifying opportunities to supplement their real-asset portfolios with operational expertise. In this increasingly competitive investment market, to achieve desired returns, investors need a sophisticated approach to financing and identifying the appropriate operational teams and partners. These dynamics illustrate just how quickly the real estate industry is evolving. And it highlights the importance of real estate to the functioning of the global economy.

The insurance sector has been playing an increasingly important role as an alternative source of capital as investor fund allocations shift from real estate assets to infrastructure and other asset classes. Private capital players have entered the insurance sector through acquisitions or strategic relationships. Examples include Apollo’s investment in Athene and KKR’s acquisition of Global Atlantic, both of which have continued to scale rapidly, along with similar financial vehicles sponsored by others, such as Blackstone and Brookfield. These vehicles were created as a way for private capital firms to access long-term capital at a time when higher interest rates put pressure on returns. Essentially, they unlocked new lending capabilities at a more favourable cost of capital.
These relationships with insurance companies are critically important for the real estate industry at a time in which some traditional financing sources have reduced their allocations to the industry. However, the insurance capital dynamic is broader than this. Some market participants believe owning assets within insurance companies creates more value than owning them in traditional real estate structures, and they have restructured the ownership of portfolios in response—in some cases, concluding that they should run a global real estate investment business moving forward.
All of this goes to show just how complex the operating environment is, how industry sectors continue to converge and how important real estate is to market participants. We expect to see more activity in this space as it continues to have a material impact on the real estate industry.
Over the past decade, some companies with significant real estate assets have elected to change the ownership structure of their businesses for the purpose of improving capital efficiency and increasing enterprise value. We have begun to see this trend in other sectors, as companies shift from asset- and capital-intensive balance sheets to asset-light operations.
Early movers included hospitality brands such as Hilton and La Quinta who spun off owned hotel assets into separate public hotel real estate investment trusts. Others, such as Wyndham and Marriott, separated their hotel and timeshare assets into separate companies though spin-offs. Meanwhile, gaming operators such as VICI Properties and Gaming and Leisure Properties spun off their owned casino assets into separate publicly traded gaming real estate investment trusts.
Looking forward, other sectors that we expect to pursue this path include wellness industry operators, renewable energy manufacturers, technology companies and consumer brands. Private equity, sovereign wealth funds and foreign pension funds can serve as an ‘off-ramp’ for these assets and create long-term investment opportunities which capitalise on macroeconomic and demographic trends.
In 2025, we expect to see a rise in real estate M&A activity driven by favourable economic conditions, lower interest rates and available capital. This growth may be tempered by global trade and other uncertainties. At the same time, we note the rise of a number of alternative asset classes which yield higher returns. Successful dealmakers will navigate this evolving landscape adeptly and employ advanced strategies to structure and finance deals with the right partners.

2025 Outlook
Christian K. Moldt
Global Health Industries Deals Leader, PwC Germany
Portfolio gaps, supply chain uncertainty, changes in policy direction and other fundamental factors are expected to drive M&A by health industries companies in 2025. We believe a stronger US and European deal market, spurred by improving macroeconomic factors and the expectation of lighter US regulation, will lead to accelerated deal values and volumes over the next year.
In the pharmaceuticals and life sciences sector, large-cap pharma companies are looking to acquire innovative late-stage biotech companies to help further differentiate their portfolios and reposition for growth. For example, in July 2024 Biogen acquired Human Immunology Biosciences; in August 2024 Eli Lilly acquired Morphic and in January 2025 Johnson & Johnson announced their proposed acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies.
With Big Pharma facing a significant drop in revenue over the next few years due to imminent patent cliffs, we expect them to undertake acquisitions to fill gaps in their portfolios, focus attention on targeted therapeutic areas and aim for greater innovation in select products. This also includes gaining entry into emerging areas. In addition, we expect them to continue to evaluate divestments of lower-growth or non-core assets that compete for internal management attention and resources. Examples of this divestiture strategy include Viatris’ sale of its over-the-counter business to Cooper Consumer Health, its active pharmaceutical ingredients division to Matrix Pharma Private and its women’s health business to Insud Pharma.
In the healthcare services sector, companies will continue to acquire digital assets or technology companies, including the exploration of AI-enabled services, to deliver a cost-effective high standard of care. Recent examples include Cantata Health Solutions’ acquisition of Geisler IT Services and Cardinal Health’s acquisition of Specialty Networks and its PPS Analytics platform.
Private equity (PE).PE still has significant capital it is looking to deploy and a growing pipeline of potential divestiture candidates, as funds reach the end of their holding period. In the PE community, interest in medtech and digital health companies is rising, as illustrated by the February 2024 acquisition by KKR of a 50% stake in Cotiviti, a healthcare data and technology business, or the proposed acquisition by TowerBrook and CD&R of R1 RCM, a provider of technology-driven solutions to the healthcare industry. This trend will likely last through 2025, with exciting targets expected to come to market. In health services, legislative headwinds, funding cuts, and overall yields below expectations will affect valuations and investment decisions, particularly in clinics and medical service centres or group practices in certain geographies.
‘I am increasingly, but still cautiously, optimistic about the M&A market in 2025 across health industries. I see signs of a growing pressure to act among dealmakers. Declining interest rates and an anticipated easing of regulations will create a more deal-friendly environment.’
Dealmaking obstacles.There is growing optimism that some obstacles impeding dealmaking in recent years are subsiding as global interest rates fall back amid signs in the US that antitrust regulators may adopt a more relaxed stance to mergers in general under the new administration; however, it remains to be seen whether this will indeed be the case, and to what degree it could affect pharma and other healthcare players.
IPO markets.With activity in the initial public offering (IPO) market expected to pick up in 2025, this will unlock additional sources of capital and funding. A number of companies are preparing to go public, both in the US and in other jurisdictions. In late 2024, a growing number of pharmaceutical and life sciences companies confidentially filed their IPO registration documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating their intention to go public in 2025. Outside the US, several other companies have announced plans to go public, including Polish medical diagnostic company Diagnostyka, Swiss clinical-stage biotechnology company Topadur and Swiss company Xlife Sciences, which announced plans to separately list its portfolio company, Veraxa Biotech, on the US Nasdaq stock market in 2025.

Large-cap pharma companies continue to face patent cliffs and gaps in their drug pipelines and will look for M&A opportunities to fill these gaps and achieve their growth plans. For years, investing in time-intensive research with uncertain outcomes and significant time to market was not the priority for big pharma; rather, the strategy has been to fill the pipeline through biotech integrations and bolt-on deals of assets with a more certain study outcome and market potential. Midsize biotech companies with strong revenue potential are likely to receive significant attention in 2025, with those companies with drugs in Phase III trials that could come to market relatively quickly likely to receive the most attention versus those in earlier stages.
Biotechnology M&A trends have evolved significantly since the pandemic. From 2019 to 2020, investments surged by 128%, followed by growth in minority investments from PE firms, which reached a peak in 2022. A shift occurred in 2022, as full acquisitions by strategic players (takeover deals) once again outpaced minority investments and returned to pre-2020 trends. PE firms and other financial investors have subsequently scaled back their involvement in the industry. This shift has influenced the focus of investments: partial acquisitions were primarily directed at companies in the early stages of drug development (Phase I and early-stage Phase II), whereas full acquisitions targeted companies with products in later stages of development (late-stage Phase II or Phase III) or those with recently approved drugs. In contrast, venture capital investments and collaborations in biotechnology generally focus on companies with preclinical products.
Oncology remains a dominant therapeutic area, representing nearly 40% of deals and 45% of funds invested. US companies dominate M&A activity, with 80% of targets and 60% of acquirers based there. Besides PE and large pharma companies, other biotech firms and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies also invested. For example, many of the large pharma companies are adopting a science-led portfolio-driven approach to their pipeline. Although 2024 saw a slowdown in biotech deals, the numbers remain high compared to other subsectors.
Investors might continue to be more cautious, but large pharmaceutical companies still need to expand their portfolios and find new revenue sources, leading to a promising market outlook for the 2025 biotech deal landscape. However, we expect this will be characterised by smaller deals as compared to the record deal values observed in the past (based on individual deal value), while large pharmaceutical companies are likely to access highly valued assets by employing more innovative strategies, such as collaborations, alliances, or joint ventures.  Consequently, and in contrast to the broader M&A market trend of increasing momentum in megadeals, we anticipate seeing less health industries megadeals activity in 2025 than during 2024 and 2023.
In addition to biotech, we expect that portfolio optimisation, GLP-1s, telehealth, healthtech, health analytics and consumer healthcare will be hot spots for M&A activity in health industries in 2025:
Global M&A volumes and values in health industries declined between 2023 and 2024 by 20% and 29%, respectively. Pharma and life sciences deal volumes decreased by 18%, but values decreased more significantly by 31% due to fewer megadeals (deals greater than $5bn)—with ten megadeals in 2023, down to two in 2024. Healthcare services deal volumes and values declined by 22% and 21%, respectively.
With an ever-persistent business need to get deals done to stay competitive, health industries companies that proactively build the capabilities to acquire, divest and integrate the right assets will outperform the rest of the sector. As the macro and regulatory environment that has slowed health industries dealmaking in recent years begins to improve, dealmakers should be ready to act quickly on innovative assets when they hit the market. The further development of interest rates should be watched closely as well as policy changes arising from the new US administration. In particular, the anticipated easing of regulations may provide a tailwind to pharma and health industries dealmaking, not just in the US, but also globally. Health industries leaders who are already thinking several steps ahead and can successfully navigate remaining uncertainties will have a significant opportunity in 2025 to use M&A to transform their businesses for success.
Our commentary on M&A trends is based on data from industry-recognised sources and our own independent research. Specifically, deal values and volumes referenced in this publication are based on officially announced transactions, excluding rumoured and withdrawn transactions, as provided by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as of 31 December 2024 and as accessed between 6–9 January 2025. This has been supplemented by additional information from S&P Capital IQ, company filings and our independent research. Certain adjustments have been made to the source information to align with PwC’s industry mapping. All dollar amounts are in US dollars. Megadeals are defined as deals greater than $5bn in value.
The theoretical M&A capacity calculation is based on the differential between net debt and EBITDA-based total debt capacity. The calculation for 2024 is an estimate made using company websites and filing information through June 2024 as a proxy for the full year.

M&A in 2025: Big deals, winning hands, and wild cards. Megadeal momentum returns to the market—but dealmakers will need to expect the unexpected.
The healthcare industry is evolving into a dynamic ecosystem. Patients, practitioners and industry players all stand to benefit.

2025 Outlook
Christopher Sur
Global, EMEA and Germany Financial Services Deals Leader, PwC Germany
Dealmakers are optimistic about M&A in the financial services (FS) sector for 2025, building on the momentum created in 2024, which saw an increase in megadeals and growth in deal values, despite continued low deal volumes. Although some of the factors which inhibited dealmaking in 2024 have lessened, the FS industry faces continued uncertainty from macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions, as well as margin pressures in the highly competitive and regulated FS environment.
M&A continues to be an essential strategic element in helping financial services players shape their future and adjust their business models to stay relevant and generate growth. We expect that dealmaking activity in the FS industry will include acquisitions focused on both revenue and margin growth, with the intent of accessing new markets and technologies to remain competitive. For example, banks might acquire or partner with fintechs to address growing technology needs, changing client preferences or other disruptions to their business models that are taking place due to trends such as embedded finance. Divestitures will rebalance underperforming portfolios and generate capital that can be used to reinvest in higher-growth or more profitable areas.
Dealmakers are already showing an increased appetite for larger deals, and we expect this will continue in 2025. Megadeals (deals greater than $5bn) in the FS market during 2024 included Capital One’s proposed $35.3bn acquisition of Discover Financial Services in the US, Guotai Junan Securities’ proposed $14.5bn merger with Haitong Securities in China and BBVA’s proposed $13.4bn merger with Banco Sabadell in Spain.
‘The underlying pressure on industry players to drive growth and transformation will create the impetus for higher levels of financial services M&A activity in 2025. I expect more megadeals will be announced, building on the momentum from 2024. These large deals signal growing confidence among dealmakers and raise the pressure on all market participants to move.’
Under the new US administration, the United States is expected to enter an era of financial deregulation which could increase pressure on regulated financial services companies in other countries. For example, if competition stiffens for European banks, European regulators may face increasing pressure to relax or delay the implementation of more stringent capital requirements. For this reason, combined with different rates of growth in countries around the world, we expect to see greater regional differences emerging which may affect where M&A activity takes place.

Over the past decade, the fintech sector has reshaped the FS landscape globally, blurring sector boundaries, pushing traditional players to reinvent their business models and creating opportunities for M&A. A steep decline in venture capital funding in the past three years has slowed momentum, but in many countries, the fintech sector continues to grow in both strength and relevance for customers and is positioned to benefit from the ongoing transformation of the banking industry.
In Latin America (LATAM), the fintech sector is also being propelled by a broader trend playing out in several other emerging economies, including India, Southeast Asia and Africa, in which smartphones and digital technology opens up access to digital credit and banking services for previously underserved users, including in rural areas.
Fintech in LATAM stands out as fertile ground for M&A activity, especially in countries such as Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. By the end of 2023, more than 3,000 companies made up the fintech ecosystem in LATAM and the Caribbean, which has grown by 340% since 2017, according to a June 2024 report by Finnovista and Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID).
Many of these companies are startups, with a need for venture capital (VC) funding to grow. VC investment in LATAM, as elsewhere, remains below its 2021 peak, but fintech startups in the region continue to attract the most funding of all sectors. According to the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America (LAVCA), fintech startups accounted for 30% of VC deals during the first nine months of 2024, but 57% of the total VC dollars invested. Total VC dollars invested in fintech during the first nine months of 2024 in LATAM was $1.6bn, an increase of 26% compared to the first nine months of 2023. The top three countries in the region to receive VC fintech funding during the first nine months of 2024 were Mexico ($692m), followed by Brazil ($487m) and Colombia ($254m).
Data from CB Insights indicates in December 2024 that there were 32 unicorns (privately held companies with a valuation greater than $1bn) in LATAM, with over half of these unicorns in the financial services sector: nine in Brazil, five in Mexico, and one each in Argentina, Ecuador and Colombia.
Recent cuts in interest rates may boost demand for equity and reactivate the capital markets. The last LATAM fintech IPO was Brazilian neobank, Nubank’s $2.6bn capital raising in December 2021. After a prolonged pause we are now seeing some LATAM fintechs undertaking steps toward IPO readiness and expect some will likely come to market in 2025, depending on capital market conditions.
With challenging IPO markets and less venture capital available over the past few years, many fintechs have been forced to improve their operational efficiency and refine their business models, positioning some as potential acquirors to expand within the region and others as targets for expansion-minded buyers. Traditional institutions have invested heavily to develop their own fintech capabilities in recent years which will create opportunities for deals activity and monetisation through software as a service (SaaS) agreements across the spectrum from payments, automated know your customer (KYC) and compliance, and AI. We see this trend likely to continue and create opportunities for M&A, particularly across the three largest fintech segments as follows:
Even though the last couple of years have presented significant challenges with funding reductions, and valuation corrections, the fintech sector has proved to be one of the most resilient and dynamic in the LATAM region, and we expect this trend will continue in 2025 and beyond. Declining interest rates and growing interest from potential international investors keen to rebalance their portfolios will help diversify financing sources and reduce dependency on funding rounds. Together, this will likely increase M&A activity in the region and contribute to sector consolidation as well as alliances with traditional financial institutions and technology companies.
Global deal volumes in FS decreased by 13% between 2023 and 2024, but deal values told a very different story and increased by 71% over the same period. The increase in deal values was mainly because of an increase in megadeals: 16 FS megadeals were announced in 2024, compared with three in the prior year. Each sector had a greater number of megadeals, with six in insurance, five in asset and wealth management, and five in banking and capital markets.
On a regional basis, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific; and the Americas all experienced a decline in deal volume during 2024, but each maintained an approximate one-third share of the overall global total. In the Americas, deal values increased by 85% between 2023 and 2024, leading to an increase in its overall share of global deal values from 48% to 52%, respectively. Over the same period, deal values in EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 80% and 40%, respectively. The trend in deal values by region was mainly attributable to the distribution of megadeals: ten in the Americas, four in EMEA and two in Asia Pacific.
Dealmaking activity in banking and capital markets is expected to increase, especially in the US and Europe, as some of the factors inhibiting M&A between 2022 and 2024 appear to be easing. Central banks in North America and Europe started to reduce interest rates during 2024 and have signalled further rate cuts in 2025, although the pace of the reductions may be slowing. With lower borrowing costs expected to support economic activity, demand for new loans is likely to increase, boosting bank profits. These profits, in turn, can be used for dealmaking activities.
The new US administration is expected to support a roll back of regulation. This may reduce compliance costs—a significant burden for many FS companies—and boost dealmakers’ overall confidence. Despite optimism about the US economy following the election outcome, some economies are expected to enter a recession, a scenario that would increase the risk of defaults in banks’ loan books, especially in areas such as commercial real estate and consumer finance.
We see the following types of banking M&A activity in 2025:
Asset management deals continue to be driven primarily by companies’ attempts to grow revenue through expanding into new markets and products, particularly into alternative asset classes. Fundraising has more recently favoured larger-scale firms able to offer a broader product suite to customers, grow assets under management (AUM) and capitalise on the explosion of digital infrastructure and the energy required to power it sustainably.
We expect the following will be areas of interest for asset managers considering transactions in 2025:
M&A in the wealth management sector will likely focus on consolidation via acquisitions to achieve the following strategic objectives in 2025:
Overall, global insurance deal volumes declined in 2024 by 13% compared to 2023, but deal values increased by 39%, primarily due to several larger deals. The insurance subsectors which we expect to be the most active in 2025 are as follows:
Regulations will continue to influence which deals get done. Although it is anticipated that regulations may ease in the US, this may not be the case in other countries, and we expect to see insurers exiting certain business to focus on domestic markets or other countries to pursue growth.
After a relatively dry spell for FS deals, FS companies and private equity are both expected to be more active M&A participants in 2025, with an increased appetite for megadeals. Corporates are being driven by the strategic need to grow both the top and bottom line, with many needing to transform and reinvent their businesses or operating models. Private equity funds continue to view FS as an attractive area in which to invest, with many building their own specialist FS teams. The pressure to exit on the one hand and to deploy capital on the other will keep PE active in FS in 2025.
Our commentary on M&A trends is based on data provided by industry-recognised sources and our own independent research. Specifically, deal values and volumes referenced in this publication are based on officially announced transactions, excluding rumoured and withdrawn transactions, as provided by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as of 31 December 2024 and as accessed between 6–9 January 2025. This has been supplemented with additional information from S&P Capital IQ and our independent research. Certain adjustments have been made to the source information to align with PwC’s industry mapping. All dollar amounts are in US dollars. Megadeals are defined as deals greater than $5bn in value. Unicorns are defined as privately held companies with a valuation greater than $1bn.

Global Consumer Markets Deals Leader, PwC United Kingdom
We have witnessed an uptick in large deals announced during 2024 across the consumer markets sectors. This trend suggests that M&A activity in consumer markets is recovering and will strengthen in 2025, driven by renewed investor confidence and an acceleration of strategic transformations by companies looking to drive growth. Consumer sentiment has not fully recovered from the post-pandemic surge in inflation and interest rates, and some uncertainty remains, particularly regarding tariffs, geopolitical conflicts and the impact of climate change. However, increasing valuations in the sector and heightened pipeline activity indicate growing optimism among dealmakers and a pick-up in M&A volumes and value for the coming year.
Macroeconomic uncertainties, financing challenges and misaligned expectations around price between sellers and buyers muted M&A activity in consumer markets in the past two years. In 2024, consumer markets deal volumes were 16% lower than in 2023, but deal values increased 13%, highlighting the impact of several larger deals that were announced during the past year.
As we begin 2025, some of these negative factors are easing. For example, despite price pressures persisting in some countries, global inflation appears to be largely tamed, with interest rates stabilising, albeit at a higher level than before. Estimates from the International Monetary Fund suggest that global GDP will remain steady at a projected growth rate of 3.2% between 2024 and 2025, slightly below the average 3.7% GDP growth rate of the two decades prior to the pandemic. Markets have taken note; valuations in consumer markets are rising, with PitchBook data showing that North American and European EBITDA multiples for the consumer sector increased from 9.0 in 2023 to 9.5 in the third quarter of 2024, and revenue multiples for the sector also increased from 1.0 to 1.2 over the same period.
Recently, the improving macroeconomic picture has contributed to growth in global real wages in some advanced economies. However, consumer purchasing power and sentiment continue to be affected by the inflation legacy. Higher household savings rates in some countries reflect this consumer caution. For example, in Europe, household savings increased from 7.3% in 2022 to an expected 8.2% in early 2025, about 1.5% above pre-pandemic levels.
While there is often a lag between better economic news and consumer perceptions of the state of the economy, the current disconnect suggests that we may be facing a lingering ‘vibecession’ on the consumer front.
‘Even if consumers appear to be going through a “vibecession”, there are clear signs that the consumer markets deal pipeline is filling up, backed by investor activity and easing market conditions.’
During the recent period of inflation-driven price increases, consumer companies experienced volume compression. But that phase seems to have ended, and we see corporate operators actively managing their portfolios to drive business performance, whether through divesting certain categories, reinforcing their positions in others, entering new markets or developing new ways to address new customer needs. Recent examples of announced deals in 2024 include Mars’ proposed acquisition of Kellanova and Unilever’s proposed separation of its ice cream business.
We also expect a number of consumer assets held by private equity (PE) to come to market in 2025. Over the past few years, PE holding periods have extended across all sectors. Based on an analysis of European PE exits performed by Gain.pro, consumer markets’ assets have the unwelcome distinction of having the longest holding period of any sector: the average holding time for consumer assets exited in 2023 to 2024 rose to 6.3 years from 5.1 years in 2019 to 2020. The combination of improving valuations and exit conditions, along with the pressure to release cash to limited partners and close funds, will likely be a significant driver of further M&A activity. This bodes well for 2025 exit activity of consumer assets.
The trend in take-private and delisting transactions—such as the delisting of Tod’s following the acquisition of the brand by L Catterton; Apollo’s proposed acquisition of International Game Technology’s gaming and digital business; and International Paper’s proposed acquisition of DS Smith—is expected to continue into 2025, particularly in markets outside the US where public valuations in the sector may remain subdued.

Environmental regulation and consumer perception of businesses’ environmental profiles increasingly factor into investment decisions, particularly affecting the packaging, retail and consumer goods sectors. The ability to demonstrate the sustainability of business results in the face of upcoming legislation, especially in Europe, is a critical success factor in many M&A processes.
Overall market conditions for the food and beverage industry are expected to become more favourable in 2025. Commodity food indices are expected to continue to fall in 2025 from their inflation-driven heights in 2022, enabling further price reductions and supporting volume recovery.
Continued portfolio reviews will create M&A opportunities, following a spate of dealmaking in 2024, such as Mars’ proposed $36bn acquisition of global snacking business Kellanova, Carlsberg’s proposed acquisition of soft drinks company Britvic, and General Mills’ announcement of the disposal of its North American yogurt business to Lactalis and Sodiaal, two leading French dairy companies. The pipeline for M&A activity in this sector is robust as we enter 2025, driven by large carve-outs from global operators in the consumer packaged goods sector. For example, in addition to Unilever’s intended separation of its ice cream business, the company’s CEO announced plans to divest about $1bn in food company assets. Reckitt also announced plans to sharpen its brand portfolio, including exiting its Essential Home portfolio of home care brands that are no longer core. The company is also considering strategic options for its Mead Johnson Nutrition business.
Consumer health M&A activity is expected to remain steady in 2025, following a trend set by some notable deals announced during 2024. For example, in June 2024, Dr. Reddy’s, a global pharmaceutical company, agreed to acquire Haleon’s global portfolio (outside the US) of consumer healthcare brands in the nicotine replacement therapy category. In July 2024, Cooper Consumer Health completed its acquisition of Viatris’ over-the-counter business. In October 2024, CD&R agreed to acquire a 50% controlling interest in Sanofi’s Opella consumer healthcare business, with Sanofi agreeing to remain a significant shareholder. We expect large operators to continue to review their portfolios, resulting in both selective acquisitions and disposals. Recently spun-off or divestedconsumer health businesses are expected to accelerate their own transformation plans via M&A. We also see a robust pipeline of PE-held businesses in this sector which should come to market in 2025, further supporting strong activity levels.
Consumer demand for pet products and services has remained resilient and is expected to continue to grow, supported by strong underlying demographic trends and consumer preferences. The sector was active in 2024 from an M&A point of view: from June to August 2024, CVC agreed to acquire a majority stake in Partner in Pet Food, a European pet food company; Fressnapf Group acquired Arcaplanet, an Italian pet care retailer; and Bansk Group announced plans to acquire the entire share capital of PetIQ, a US pet medication, health and wellness company. We expect M&A in the pet care sector to remain active in 2025.
The past year saw some large deals announced in the sector, such as Couche-Tard’s offer to acquire Seven & i Holdings Co (known for its 7-Eleven franchise) and the acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group by Hudson’s Bay Company (Saks Global). Walmart’s acquisition of Vizio Holding Corp, completed in December 2024, illustrates the drive by retailers to leverage their brand and engage with consumers across a broad range of channels.
Fashion remains challenged and we expect this will lead to M&A driven by owners of ‘brand stables’ which offer synergies. Examples of recent retail brand deals include Authentic Brands’ acquisition of the Champion brands from Hanesbrands, completed in September 2024, and EssilorLuxottica’s acquisition of the Supreme brand from VF Corporation, completed in October 2024.
Other M&A activity in retail may arise from some levels of distress, with assets picked up by consolidators benefitting from healthier balance sheets and opportunities for synergies and growth.
Whilst consumer sentiment continues to weigh on discretionary spending, there are signs that the sector is picking up. According to the UN Tourism’s World Tourism Barometer, the global tourism sector recovered to 99% of pre-pandemic levels in 2024 and is expected to remain healthy in 2025. M&A activity has centered around hotels, with large transactions such as the announced merger of special purpose acquisition company JVSPAC Acquisition Corp with Singapore-based Hotel101 Global and Ares Management’s acquisitions of two portfolios of hotel assets from Hyatt Hotels Corp and Land Securities Group Plc. Travel agencies have also attracted investor interest, such as American Express Global Business Travel’s proposed acquisition of global business travel and meeting solutions provider CWT Holdings and Concord Sponsor Group II LLC’s proposed acquisition of Events.com, an event management platform company.
In the US and Europe, several restaurant operators have recently changed hands. This points to a more dynamic environment in 2025 for this subsector, in which established operators are looking to M&A to support growth. In April 2024, CVC acquired Italian restaurant chain La Piadineria, and in May 2024, global food service company Compass Group acquired CH&CO, a premium provider of contract and hospitality services in the UK and Ireland.
With demand for gaming and sports-related entertainment expected to grow as consumer preferences continue to shift from products to experiences, we anticipate sustained levels of investment in the sector in 2025. This follows an active dealmaking environment in 2024, which included Apollo’s $6.3bn proposed acquisition of International Game Technology’s gaming and digital business and Everi; and Formula One owner Liberty Media’s proposed $4.5bn acquisition of an 86% interest in MotoGP rights holder Dorna Sports.
Although several large transactions were announced in 2024, such as International Paper’s proposed acquisition of DS Smith and Sonoco Products’ December 2024 acquisition of Eviosys, we also saw some unsuccessful deal processes in the sector, such as Lone Star’s rejected offer to acquire Australian glass manufacturer Orora. The challenges of higher input costs and greater regulatory uncertainty, particularly relating to developing environmental regulations, have stalled some processes and slowed other packaging assets from coming to market. In 2025, we expect to see some of these deal processes start again, as conditions stabilise and businesses can more clearly demonstrate how they will meet evolving environmental targets.
We expect 2025 will see a continuation of trends from recent years, as the world’s largest shipping companies seek to restructure and expand their operations through M&A. In September 2024, DSV announced its proposed $15.9bn acquisition of logistics business Schenker to boost its global logistics capabilities and expand its market reach. Overall, global uncertainties will continue to weigh on international logistics M&A, while we expect land-based logistics M&A to be driven by consolidation.
M&A volumes in consumer markets decreased between 2023 and 2024 by 16%, performing slightly better than the overall global M&A markets, which saw an 18% decline in deal volumes over the same period. Consumer markets’ deal values increased by 13%, primarily because of two deals valued at more than $30bn and six other megadeals (deals greater than $5bn).
M&A trends were not uniform across countries or regions:
Growth is back on the agenda for consumer markets for 2025, with profitable growth in volumes the main goal for most operators in the sector. We expect significant portfolio consolidation activity on the corporate front and a greater number of liquidity-driven exits on the private equity front. This makes for a stronger deals pipeline for the sector than we have seen in several years.
Our commentary on M&A trends is based on data from industry-recognised sources and our own independent research. Specifically, deal values and volumes referenced in this publication are based on officially announced transactions, excluding rumoured and withdrawn transactions, as provided by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as of 31 December 2024 and as accessed between 6–9 January 2025. Data on deal multiples is based on data from PitchBook. This data has been supplemented with additional information from S&P Capital IQ and our independent research. Certain adjustments have been made to the source information to align with PwC’s industry mapping. All dollar amounts are in US dollars. Megadeals are defined as deals greater than $5bn in value.

In 2025, we expect to see some of these deal processes start again, as conditions stabilise and businesses can more clearly demonstrate how they will meet evolving environmental targets.
We expect 2025 will see a continuation of trends from recent years, as the world’s largest shipping companies seek to restructure and expand their operations through M&A. In September 2024, DSV announced its proposed $15.9bn acquisition of logistics business Schenker to boost its global logistics capabilities and expand its market reach. Overall, global uncertainties will continue to weigh on international logistics M&A, while we expect land-based logistics M&A to be driven by consolidation.
M&A volumes in consumer markets decreased between 2023 and 2024 by 16%, performing slightly better than the overall global M&A markets, which saw an 18% decline in deal volumes over the same period. Consumer markets’ deal values increased by 13%, primarily because of two deals valued at more than $30bn and six other megadeals (deals greater than $5bn).
M&A trends were not uniform across countries or regions:
Growth is back on the agenda for consumer markets for 2025, with profitable growth in volumes the main goal for most operators in the sector. We expect significant portfolio consolidation activity on the corporate front and a greater number of liquidity-driven exits on the private equity front. This makes for a stronger deals pipeline for the sector than we have seen in several years.
Our commentary on M&A trends is based on data from industry-recognised sources and our own independent research. Specifically, deal values and volumes referenced in this publication are based on officially announced transactions, excluding rumoured and withdrawn transactions, as provided by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as of 31 December 2024 and as accessed between 6–9 January 2025. Data on deal multiples is based on data from PitchBook. This data has been supplemented with additional information from S&P Capital IQ and our independent research. Certain adjustments have been made to the source information to align with PwC’s industry mapping. All dollar amounts are in US dollars. Megadeals are defined as deals greater than $5bn in value.

2025 Outlook
Greg Oberti
National Energy Transition & Utilities Deals Leader, Partner, PwC Canada
Entering 2025, the energy transition remains the most significant driver of M&A activity in the global energy, resources and utilities (EU&R) industry. However, the shape and pace of change will vary significantly by both region and sector as factors such as geopolitics, energy security, the surging demand for energy needed to power AI and other market dynamics play out.
As global players navigate these regional dynamics, the race to secure reliable, affordable and sustainable energy sources is intensifying, setting the stage for robust M&A activity across all elements of EU&R in 2025.
In the US, the re-election of Donald Trump as president has ushered in a policy landscape favoring fossil fuels that may also roll back some environmental regulations. This shift is expected to drive investments in natural gas infrastructure and fossil generation assets, while renewable energy is expected to continue to benefit from long-term support despite near-term uncertainties. Nuclear power is once again being considered to help meet soaring demand for emissions-free electricity, with plans to bring certain decommissioned nuclear power reactors back online.
In Europe, energy security remains paramount as the region seeks to reduce dependency on external energy sources. The European Union is intensifying its focus on renewables, grid modernisation and energy storage, although regulatory challenges and high costs could temper deal activity.
Like the US, Japan is reviving its nuclear energy ambitions, while increasing its reliance on critical mineral imports to meet growing domestic energy demands.
In China, with the accelerated growth in electric vehicles, we expect to see an uptick in M&A activity as companies adapt to larger scale economy requirements; this will result in an increase in sector consolidation (particularly in the solar sector) and in supporting sectors such as energy storage and critical minerals.
Latin America is emerging as a hot spot for renewable energy investment, with its abundant solar and wind resources attracting global capital. Rising interest in lithium and other critical minerals will also fuel M&A activity in the region’s mining sector, particularly in Chile and Peru.
Africa offers significant opportunities for investors as nations seek to bridge energy access gaps. Investments in natural gas, hydroelectric projects and decentralised renewable systems are set to accelerate, supported by increasing demand from both domestic markets and global commodity buyers.
India’s ambitious decarbonisation targets are reshaping its energy landscape. The country’s growing appetite for renewable infrastructure, alongside strategic investments in coal and critical minerals, underscores the delicate balancing act between energy security and sustainability facing developed and developing countries alike.
We first discussed a ‘reconfiguration imperative’ in our 2024 mid-year outlook and highlighted how megatrends such as climate, technology and demographic shifts are disrupting business models and driving EU&R M&A activity globally.
At the heart of all of this is a massive move towards cross-sector interdependency with companies acquiring, allying and partnering in novel ways and across industries. Companies are doing so to capture market share, drive value, secure critical supply chains and position themselves technologically. The growing importance of such moves will increasingly shape M&A strategies, with particular significance among energy, utilities and resources players, given the central role they are likely to play in many of the transitions ahead.
Dynamic changes to the business landscape are creating new value pools. These are no longer defined by sectors but instead are driven by thematic domains of activity which are a nexus of different sectors. At PwC, we think of this reconfiguration as playing out across six domains: how we fuel, how we move, how we build, how we make, how we feed ourselves and how we care. In each domain, new ecosystems are emerging that not only inform our thinking but underscore the cross-industry alliances and partnerships that are starting to form all over the world.
‘We see significant cross-sector interdependencies emerging as part of the industrial reconfiguration across the energy, utilities, resources and chemicals sectors. Companies' efforts to strategically reposition themselves will create the catalyst for M&A, partnerships and other alliances—in 2025 and for many years to come.’
In an EU&R context, we see examples of this cross-sector interdependency in the ‘how we move’ domain, among others. Companies will engage in M&A as they look to reconfigure to strategically gain access to raw materials, obtain adjacent technologies or expertise, shore up supply chains and secure energy needs. Thus, mining companies will partner with, or even become acquisition targets of, automotive players to secure lithium supplies for electric vehicle battery production, as illustrated by Volkswagen’s December 2024 acquisition of 9.9% of lithium developer Patriot Battery. We expect further deals activity related to critical minerals and focused on other areas such as emergent technology platforms centered on companies aiming to solidify their strategic position in an increasingly multipolar geopolitical context.
We also see EU&R applicable examples in other domains, including, “how we build” and “how we make”. For example, we expect EU&R companies to connect with construction firms or manufacturing companies. These types of connections could play out in a number of ways and act as a conduit for companies to collaborate across industries to achieve scale, grow revenue streams and secure supply chains. In 2024, we saw the continuation and acceleration of this trend; for example, in the “how we build” domain, BP signed notable global alliances in June 2024 with Worley, an Australian engineering services company, and in August 2024 with Wood, a global engineering consulting company, to drive efficiency, continuous improvement and enhanced site development. In the “how we make” domain, Canadian company Bruce Power's March 2024 alliance with GE Vernova's steam power business is intended to better secure its critical supply chain and drive efficiency across its operations.

The EU&R sectors are at the heart of efforts to balance sustainability, reliability and growth. We see four key themes shaping M&A in this dynamic environment in 2025.
Energy security remains a key driver of M&A as countries prioritise reliable and diversified energy supplies amid geopolitical tensions and shifting alliances. Under the new US administration, US policy will likely favour fossil fuel investments to strengthen domestic energy independence. Europe will continue pushing to reduce reliance on imports, particularly from Russia. These dynamics are fostering cross-border deals in natural gas, nuclear and critical infrastructure assets.
The global shift toward decarbonisation will spur M&A in areas including battery storage and critical minerals. The rising demand for lithium, cobalt and nickel—which are essential for energy storage and electric vehicle production—is driving mining deals, particularly in Latin America, Australia and Africa. M&A in renewable energy is also expected to remain active, with companies acquiring renewable assets and investing in infrastructure to support green hydrogen, electric vehicles and grid modernisation. Examples include KKR’s takeover of Encavis, a German renewable energy platform and independent power producer, and Iberdrola’s acquisition of Electricity North West, a UK energy network operator.
The rapid adoption of AI, cloud computing and digital transformation is creating unprecedented demand for energy-intensive data centers. This is leading to novel partnerships andacquisitions to secure power supply for these facilities, such as the AI partnership announced in September 2024 among BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft and a leading AI investor from the Middle East to invest in data centres and supporting power infrastructure. Investments in smart grids and energy management systems are also rising to enhance efficiency and resilience.
The lines between energy, utilities and resources will continue to blur as companies seek synergies to address evolving energy needs. We see this with technology firms investing in renewables and energy storage for data centers, while traditional energy companies are acquiring digital solutions to enhance operations. Likewise, industrial players are teaming up with energy firms to secure reliable power to decarbonise manufacturing. This convergence will fuel innovative partnerships, such as the formation in October 2024 of an industrial association by a group of German companies to accelerate the commercialisation of fusion energy technology. M&A activity will continue to cut across traditional industry boundaries.

Although global EU&R deal volumes decreased by 8% between 2023 and 2024, the industry performed better than the overall global M&A markets, which saw an 18% decline in deal volumes over the same period. Deal values decreased by 23% between 2023 and 2024. This was primarily due to fewer megadeals (deals greater than $5bn): ten such megadeals were announced in 2024, compared with 16 in the prior year. Furthermore, in 2023, two deals worth more than $50bn each were announced: Exxon’s acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and Chevron’s proposed acquisition of Hess. The largest EU&R deal announced in 2024 was the $26bn merger between Diamondback Energy and Endeavor Energy Resources.
Mining is uniquely situated at the beginning of the supply chain of most sectors globally, a fact that has driven and will continue to drive strong M&A activity into 2025 and beyond. Recent M&A activity highlights ongoing consolidation trends and strategic repositioning, with a continued focus on the critical mineral, gold, copper and coal sectors. Notable examples include:
However, challenges persist which could still derail some dealmaking, including regulatory delays, persistent pricing expectation gaps between buyers and sellers, geopolitical factors and other deal-specific complexities. Despite these factors, we believe 2025 is poised for heightened deal activity as companies also benefit from reduced political uncertainty and a recent lowering of interest rates.
Key 2025 M&A trends for mining and metals include:
Given the mining sector’s increasingly critical contribution to global industries, we anticipate that strong deal activity will continue in 2025. Mining companies are looking to position themselves to adapt to the opportunities that the sector presents in playing the pivotal role of shaping the future, today.
The oil and gas sector is demonstrating its resilience as it adapts to shifting market conditions and the global push for decarbonisation. Recent M&A trends highlight ongoing consolidation, portfolio diversification and the increasing integration of clean-energy solutions. Notable deals include:
The oil and gas sector is navigating the intersection of traditional energy demands and the transition to cleaner technologies. To that end, we expect major themes driving M&A in 2025 to include:
Companies that successfully navigate these shifts, whether by acquiring established assets or by integrating renewable solutions, will be poised to dominate the future energy landscape. We believe that M&A activity in 2025 will be pivotal in defining the oil and gas landscape for the balance of this decade.
The power and utilities sector is poised for a dynamic year in 2025, driven by a convergence of growing energy demands, technological advancements and geopolitical influences.
A key M&A driver is the burgeoning demand for data centres, fueled by the rapid growth of AI, cloud computing and digital infrastructure, which is forcing energy markets to respond. A key difference between hyperscale data centres and other energy consumers is that they place greater emphasis on reliability and speed of energy access over cost. This power demand growth is likely to revitalise investments in conventional power sources such as modernised nuclear technology as well as innovative renewable solutions such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) paired with thermal generation. Likewise, the growing pursuit of small modular reactor technology underscores the global prioritisation of sustainable, utility-scale energy solutions, albeit with potentially longer lead times.
Navigating political and market uncertainties
Investor interest in renewables remains strong. However, policy uncertainty, particularly following the re-election of Donald Trump as US president, has introduced some caution to the renewables market, not just in the US but globally. Policies favoring traditional energy sources and relaxed environmental regulations are likely to spur fossil fuel investments in the US, particularly in natural gas infrastructure.
This dual focus reflects the sector’s transitional phase, in which near-term reliance on conventional power coexists with long-term commitments to decarbonisation. The new US administration will likely further slow the pace of renewable deals in the US, underscoring the impact political shifts and evolving regulatory landscapes can have on M&A. In the US, reductions in subsidies and incentives in addition to potential tariffs are anticipated to curtail growth in both wind and solar. However, several individual states continue to independently support renewable targets while arguing that key technologies are already competitive on a stand-alone and levelized-cost basis.
In Europe, despite ongoing political and regulatory uncertainty, we see wind, solar, energy storage, EV charging and energy efficiency as areas that will attract the most investor interest and lead to a healthy flow of deals in 2025. With earlier-stage investing more difficult than in prior years, this may lead to some consolidation. This was articulated in PwC’sState of Climate Tech 2024report, published in December 2024, which found that in the first three quarters of 2024, 61% of corporate climate tech deals were either mid-stage or late-stage—more than twice the percentage in 2018. We accordingly expect the trend of global investment dollars increasingly flowing into proven climate technologies will continue in 2025.
Opportunities ahead
The evolving energy landscape offers significant opportunities for strategic and financial investors. While short-term uncertainty may temper investments in renewables, the long-term value proposition remains strong. Dealmakers should anticipate heightened M&A activity in fossil fuel assets, yet remain agile to capitalise on renewables as government incentives stabilise across multiple markets.
As the sector adapts to meet rising energy demands and shifting political landscapes, 2025 promises to be a transformative year for power and utilities M&A, marked by a strategic balancing of investments in conventional and renewable energy.
Deal value and volume in the chemicals industry ended 2024 below 2023 levels but showed signs of rebounding in the second half of the year, driven by central bank rate cuts, moderating inflation and easing destocking trends. This deals momentum is expected to continue in 2025, provided economic and political uncertainties continue to diminish in key markets. Factors such as domestic industrial policies, global supply chain realignments and increased private equity exits are likely to boost deal activity in chemicals.
Key regional developments shaping the deals landscape in chemicals include:
Many strategic buyers are pursuing smaller tuck-in acquisitions aimed at enhancing technology, portfolios and geographic reach, rather than large transformational deals. Private equity funds with assets at or approaching the end of their hold periods are expected to drive more exits, increasing the availability of assets for sale.
These dynamics point to a steady resurgence in chemicals M&A activity, underscored by evolving market priorities and strategic realignments.
Global M&A activity in the energy, utilities, mining and chemicals sectors is expected to gain momentum in 2025, driven by the energy transition, geopolitical stabilisation and technological advancements. Investments in renewable energy, grid modernisation and critical minerals for clean energy technologies will dominate. Fossil fuel assets may see consolidation as traditional energy players rebalance portfolios. Emerging markets will attract interest because of resource availability and supportive policies. Private equity and sovereign funds will remain active, while strategic buyers focus on climate-related acquisitions.
Going forward, we also see cross-sector interdependencies growing in importance. With the energy, utilities and resources sectors being central to how these interdependencies will play out, this is an area that savvy executives and dealmakers will need to consider as they develop their M&A strategies in response to the reconfiguration imperative facing their companies.
Our commentary on M&A trends is based on data from industry-recognised sources and our own independent research. Specifically, deal values and volumes referenced in this publication are based on officially announced transactions, excluding rumoured and withdrawn transactions, as provided by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as of 31 December 2024 and accessed between 6–9 January 2025. This has been supplemented by additional information from S&P Capital IQ and our independent research. Certain adjustments have been made to the source information to align with PwC’s industry mapping. All dollar amounts are in US dollars. Megadeals are defined as deals greater than $5bn in value.

M&A in 2025: Big deals, winning hands, and wild cards. Megadeal momentum returns to the market—but dealmakers will need to expect the unexpected.
Given their long-term investment horizon, sovereign wealth funds and large public pension funds can help bridge the gap in financing the energy transition.
Europe’s net-zero transition needs an investment of US$32 trillion by 2050. This requires tripling investments yearly and developing financing strategies.
PwC’s 21st Mine report focuses on how the industry is planning for impact—retooling and reimagining itself to be a key contributor to sustainable growth.

2025 Outlook
Greg Oberti
National Energy Transition & Utilities Deals Leader, Partner, PwC Canada
Entering 2025, the energy transition remains the most significant driver of M&A activity in the global energy, resources and utilities (EU&R) industry. However, the shape and pace of change will vary significantly by both region and sector as factors such as geopolitics, energy security, the surging demand for energy needed to power AI and other market dynamics play out.
As global players navigate these regional dynamics, the race to secure reliable, affordable and sustainable energy sources is intensifying, setting the stage for robust M&A activity across all elements of EU&R in 2025.
In the US, the re-election of Donald Trump as president has ushered in a policy landscape favoring fossil fuels that may also roll back some environmental regulations. This shift is expected to drive investments in natural gas infrastructure and fossil generation assets, while renewable energy is expected to continue to benefit from long-term support despite near-term uncertainties. Nuclear power is once again being considered to help meet soaring demand for emissions-free electricity, with plans to bring certain decommissioned nuclear power reactors back online.
In Europe, energy security remains paramount as the region seeks to reduce dependency on external energy sources. The European Union is intensifying its focus on renewables, grid modernisation and energy storage, although regulatory challenges and high costs could temper deal activity.
Like the US, Japan is reviving its nuclear energy ambitions, while increasing its reliance on critical mineral imports to meet growing domestic energy demands.
In China, with the accelerated growth in electric vehicles, we expect to see an uptick in M&A activity as companies adapt to larger scale economy requirements; this will result in an increase in sector consolidation (particularly in the solar sector) and in supporting sectors such as energy storage and critical minerals.
Latin America is emerging as a hot spot for renewable energy investment, with its abundant solar and wind resources attracting global capital. Rising interest in lithium and other critical minerals will also fuel M&A activity in the region’s mining sector, particularly in Chile and Peru.
Africa offers significant opportunities for investors as nations seek to bridge energy access gaps. Investments in natural gas, hydroelectric projects and decentralised renewable systems are set to accelerate, supported by increasing demand from both domestic markets and global commodity buyers.
India’s ambitious decarbonisation targets are reshaping its energy landscape. The country’s growing appetite for renewable infrastructure, alongside strategic investments in coal and critical minerals, underscores the delicate balancing act between energy security and sustainability facing developed and developing countries alike.
We first discussed a ‘reconfiguration imperative’ in our 2024 mid-year outlook and highlighted how megatrends such as climate, technology and demographic shifts are disrupting business models and driving EU&R M&A activity globally.
At the heart of all of this is a massive move towards cross-sector interdependency with companies acquiring, allying and partnering in novel ways and across industries. Companies are doing so to capture market share, drive value, secure critical supply chains and position themselves technologically. The growing importance of such moves will increasingly shape M&A strategies, with particular significance among energy, utilities and resources players, given the central role they are likely to play in many of the transitions ahead.
Dynamic changes to the business landscape are creating new value pools. These are no longer defined by sectors but instead are driven by thematic domains of activity which are a nexus of different sectors. At PwC, we think of this reconfiguration as playing out across six domains: how we fuel, how we move, how we build, how we make, how we feed ourselves and how we care. In each domain, new ecosystems are emerging that not only inform our thinking but underscore the cross-industry alliances and partnerships that are starting to form all over the world.
‘We see significant cross-sector interdependencies emerging as part of the industrial reconfiguration across the energy, utilities, resources and chemicals sectors. Companies' efforts to strategically reposition themselves will create the catalyst for M&A, partnerships and other alliances—in 2025 and for many years to come.’
In an EU&R context, we see examples of this cross-sector interdependency in the ‘how we move’ domain, among others. Companies will engage in M&A as they look to reconfigure to strategically gain access to raw materials, obtain adjacent technologies or expertise, shore up supply chains and secure energy needs. Thus, mining companies will partner with, or even become acquisition targets of, automotive players to secure lithium supplies for electric vehicle battery production, as illustrated by Volkswagen’s December 2024 acquisition of 9.9% of lithium developer Patriot Battery. We expect further deals activity related to critical minerals and focused on other areas such as emergent technology platforms centered on companies aiming to solidify their strategic position in an increasingly multipolar geopolitical context.
We also see EU&R applicable examples in other domains, including, “how we build” and “how we make”. For example, we expect EU&R companies to connect with construction firms or manufacturing companies. These types of connections could play out in a number of ways and act as a conduit for companies to collaborate across industries to achieve scale, grow revenue streams and secure supply chains. In 2024, we saw the continuation and acceleration of this trend; for example, in the “how we build” domain, BP signed notable global alliances in June 2024 with Worley, an Australian engineering services company, and in August 2024 with Wood, a global engineering consulting company, to drive efficiency, continuous improvement and enhanced site development. In the “how we make” domain, Canadian company Bruce Power's March 2024 alliance with GE Vernova's steam power business is intended to better secure its critical supply chain and drive efficiency across its operations.

The EU&R sectors are at the heart of efforts to balance sustainability, reliability and growth. We see four key themes shaping M&A in this dynamic environment in 2025.
Energy security remains a key driver of M&A as countries prioritise reliable and diversified energy supplies amid geopolitical tensions and shifting alliances. Under the new US administration, US policy will likely favour fossil fuel investments to strengthen domestic energy independence. Europe will continue pushing to reduce reliance on imports, particularly from Russia. These dynamics are fostering cross-border deals in natural gas, nuclear and critical infrastructure assets.
The global shift toward decarbonisation will spur M&A in areas including battery storage and critical minerals. The rising demand for lithium, cobalt and nickel—which are essential for energy storage and electric vehicle production—is driving mining deals, particularly in Latin America, Australia and Africa. M&A in renewable energy is also expected to remain active, with companies acquiring renewable assets and investing in infrastructure to support green hydrogen, electric vehicles and grid modernisation. Examples include KKR’s takeover of Encavis, a German renewable energy platform and independent power producer, and Iberdrola’s acquisition of Electricity North West, a UK energy network operator.
The rapid adoption of AI, cloud computing and digital transformation is creating unprecedented demand for energy-intensive data centers. This is leading to novel partnerships andacquisitions to secure power supply for these facilities, such as the AI partnership announced in September 2024 among BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft and a leading AI investor from the Middle East to invest in data centres and supporting power infrastructure. Investments in smart grids and energy management systems are also rising to enhance efficiency and resilience.
The lines between energy, utilities and resources will continue to blur as companies seek synergies to address evolving energy needs. We see this with technology firms investing in renewables and energy storage for data centers, while traditional energy companies are acquiring digital solutions to enhance operations. Likewise, industrial players are teaming up with energy firms to secure reliable power to decarbonise manufacturing. This convergence will fuel innovative partnerships, such as the formation in October 2024 of an industrial association by a group of German companies to accelerate the commercialisation of fusion energy technology. M&A activity will continue to cut across traditional industry boundaries.

Although global EU&R deal volumes decreased by 8% between 2023 and 2024, the industry performed better than the overall global M&A markets, which saw an 18% decline in deal volumes over the same period. Deal values decreased by 23% between 2023 and 2024. This was primarily due to fewer megadeals (deals greater than $5bn): ten such megadeals were announced in 2024, compared with 16 in the prior year. Furthermore, in 2023, two deals worth more than $50bn each were announced: Exxon’s acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and Chevron’s proposed acquisition of Hess. The largest EU&R deal announced in 2024 was the $26bn merger between Diamondback Energy and Endeavor Energy Resources.
Mining is uniquely situated at the beginning of the supply chain of most sectors globally, a fact that has driven and will continue to drive strong M&A activity into 2025 and beyond. Recent M&A activity highlights ongoing consolidation trends and strategic repositioning, with a continued focus on the critical mineral, gold, copper and coal sectors. Notable examples include:
However, challenges persist which could still derail some dealmaking, including regulatory delays, persistent pricing expectation gaps between buyers and sellers, geopolitical factors and other deal-specific complexities. Despite these factors, we believe 2025 is poised for heightened deal activity as companies also benefit from reduced political uncertainty and a recent lowering of interest rates.
Key 2025 M&A trends for mining and metals include:
Given the mining sector’s increasingly critical contribution to global industries, we anticipate that strong deal activity will continue in 2025. Mining companies are looking to position themselves to adapt to the opportunities that the sector presents in playing the pivotal role of shaping the future, today.
The oil and gas sector is demonstrating its resilience as it adapts to shifting market conditions and the global push for decarbonisation. Recent M&A trends highlight ongoing consolidation, portfolio diversification and the increasing integration of clean-energy solutions. Notable deals include:
The oil and gas sector is navigating the intersection of traditional energy demands and the transition to cleaner technologies. To that end, we expect major themes driving M&A in 2025 to include:
Companies that successfully navigate these shifts, whether by acquiring established assets or by integrating renewable solutions, will be poised to dominate the future energy landscape. We believe that M&A activity in 2025 will be pivotal in defining the oil and gas landscape for the balance of this decade.
The power and utilities sector is poised for a dynamic year in 2025, driven by a convergence of growing energy demands, technological advancements and geopolitical influences.
A key M&A driver is the burgeoning demand for data centres, fueled by the rapid growth of AI, cloud computing and digital infrastructure, which is forcing energy markets to respond. A key difference between hyperscale data centres and other energy consumers is that they place greater emphasis on reliability and speed of energy access over cost. This power demand growth is likely to revitalise investments in conventional power sources such as modernised nuclear technology as well as innovative renewable solutions such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) paired with thermal generation. Likewise, the growing pursuit of small modular reactor technology underscores the global prioritisation of sustainable, utility-scale energy solutions, albeit with potentially longer lead times.
Navigating political and market uncertainties
Investor interest in renewables remains strong. However, policy uncertainty, particularly following the re-election of Donald Trump as US president, has introduced some caution to the renewables market, not just in the US but globally. Policies favoring traditional energy sources and relaxed environmental regulations are likely to spur fossil fuel investments in the US, particularly in natural gas infrastructure.
This dual focus reflects the sector’s transitional phase, in which near-term reliance on conventional power coexists with long-term commitments to decarbonisation. The new US administration will likely further slow the pace of renewable deals in the US, underscoring the impact political shifts and evolving regulatory landscapes can have on M&A. In the US, reductions in subsidies and incentives in addition to potential tariffs are anticipated to curtail growth in both wind and solar. However, several individual states continue to independently support renewable targets while arguing that key technologies are already competitive on a stand-alone and levelized-cost basis.
In Europe, despite ongoing political and regulatory uncertainty, we see wind, solar, energy storage, EV charging and energy efficiency as areas that will attract the most investor interest and lead to a healthy flow of deals in 2025. With earlier-stage investing more difficult than in prior years, this may lead to some consolidation. This was articulated in PwC’sState of Climate Tech 2024report, published in December 2024, which found that in the first three quarters of 2024, 61% of corporate climate tech deals were either mid-stage or late-stage—more than twice the percentage in 2018. We accordingly expect the trend of global investment dollars increasingly flowing into proven climate technologies will continue in 2025.
Opportunities ahead
The evolving energy landscape offers significant opportunities for strategic and financial investors. While short-term uncertainty may temper investments in renewables, the long-term value proposition remains strong. Dealmakers should anticipate heightened M&A activity in fossil fuel assets, yet remain agile to capitalise on renewables as government incentives stabilise across multiple markets.
As the sector adapts to meet rising energy demands and shifting political landscapes, 2025 promises to be a transformative year for power and utilities M&A, marked by a strategic balancing of investments in conventional and renewable energy.
Deal value and volume in the chemicals industry ended 2024 below 2023 levels but showed signs of rebounding in the second half of the year, driven by central bank rate cuts, moderating inflation and easing destocking trends. This deals momentum is expected to continue in 2025, provided economic and political uncertainties continue to diminish in key markets. Factors such as domestic industrial policies, global supply chain realignments and increased private equity exits are likely to boost deal activity in chemicals.
Key regional developments shaping the deals landscape in chemicals include:
Many strategic buyers are pursuing smaller tuck-in acquisitions aimed at enhancing technology, portfolios and geographic reach, rather than large transformational deals. Private equity funds with assets at or approaching the end of their hold periods are expected to drive more exits, increasing the availability of assets for sale.
These dynamics point to a steady resurgence in chemicals M&A activity, underscored by evolving market priorities and strategic realignments.
Global M&A activity in the energy, utilities, mining and chemicals sectors is expected to gain momentum in 2025, driven by the energy transition, geopolitical stabilisation and technological advancements. Investments in renewable energy, grid modernisation and critical minerals for clean energy technologies will dominate. Fossil fuel assets may see consolidation as traditional energy players rebalance portfolios. Emerging markets will attract interest because of resource availability and supportive policies. Private equity and sovereign funds will remain active, while strategic buyers focus on climate-related acquisitions.
Going forward, we also see cross-sector interdependencies growing in importance. With the energy, utilities and resources sectors being central to how these interdependencies will play out, this is an area that savvy executives and dealmakers will need to consider as they develop their M&A strategies in response to the reconfiguration imperative facing their companies.
Our commentary on M&A trends is based on data from industry-recognised sources and our own independent research. Specifically, deal values and volumes referenced in this publication are based on officially announced transactions, excluding rumoured and withdrawn transactions, as provided by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as of 31 December 2024 and accessed between 6–9 January 2025. This has been supplemented by additional information from S&P Capital IQ and our independent research. Certain adjustments have been made to the source information to align with PwC’s industry mapping. All dollar amounts are in US dollars. Megadeals are defined as deals greater than $5bn in value.

M&A in 2025: Big deals, winning hands, and wild cards. Megadeal momentum returns to the market—but dealmakers will need to expect the unexpected.
Given their long-term investment horizon, sovereign wealth funds and large public pension funds can help bridge the gap in financing the energy transition.
Europe’s net-zero transition needs an investment of US$32 trillion by 2050. This requires tripling investments yearly and developing financing strategies.
PwC’s 21st Mine report focuses on how the industry is planning for impact—retooling and reimagining itself to be a key contributor to sustainable growth.

TakeonTomorrow
Generative AI burst onto the scene over two years ago, promising to revolutionize workplace productivity and empower employees to focus on high-impact tasks. But has it lived up to its potential? And can it truly address the productivity challenges facing businesses today?In this episode ofTake on Tomorrow, hosts Lizzie O’Leary and Femi Oke tackle these questions with Svenja Gudell, Chief Economist at the jobs site Indeed, who provides insights into how GenAI is already influencing the labor market and workplace trends. Pete Brown, PwC’s Global Workforce Leader, joins the conversation sharing key findings from a new World Economic Forum and PwC report, highlighting practical strategies for integrating GenAI to boost productivity and support workforce augmentation.With businesses striving to balance innovation and efficiency in a challenging economic climate, this episode is a timely look at how GenAI can help shape the future of work.
SVENJA GUDELL: It’s not that GenAI will take your job, right? It’s the person that knows how to use the tools that’s probably going to take your job.PETE BROWN: You can protect people, but you can’t protect jobs. Jobs will continue to evolve, they always will be.SVENJA: You have to be a bit of a dreamer, right? It’s going to be really amazing if you look into the future to see what could be with this technology.
LIZZIE O’LEARY: Two years ago, it all felt like the world—including our jobs and how we work—would change forever.
FEMI OKE: ChatGPT and other similar GenAI technologies crashed onto the scene, impacting the way we think about everything. From drug discovery to how we communicate.
LIZZIE: Now, more than two years later, how is it changing how businesses run? And how can organizations roll out the technology to create a real impact—helping workers become more productive along the way?
LIZZIE: From PwC’s management publication, strategy and business, this is Take on Tomorrow. I’m Lizzie O’Leary, a podcaster and journalist…
FEMI: …and I’m Femi Oke, a broadcaster and journalist. This week: how is GenAI transforming the job market? Today, we’ll be talking to Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Indeed, a global job site. She’s been looking into how GenAI is transforming the workforce.
LIZZIE: First, we have PwC’s Global Workforce Leader Pete Brown with us to talk about what we can learn from companies considered “early adopters” of GenAI. Welcome back to the show, Pete.
PETE: Thank you, Lizzie, thank you, Femi. It’s lovely to see you.
LIZZIE: Pete, we have talked about GenAI in the workforce and workplace on this show before. But what is the conversation that is happening today in companies? Are they eager to embrace this technology?
PETE: As I reflect through probably every single conversation I’ve had with a client in the last year, and I, dare I say, if I added all my colleagues at PwC as well, I don’t think I’ve had any conversation where the words GenAI haven’t come up. Does that mean they want to embrace it? I think it depends on the organization. Some are and some are yet to start, but it’s certainly sparked huge curiosity and interest. There’s no doubt. What was really surprising to me, though, against that backdrop and this tsunami of interest, is that we survey workers every year just to work out what’s on their mind, what’s motivating them in the world of work. And only 12% of workers say they’re using GenAI in their day-to-day work. That was a surprisingly low number for me. So, I think, to answer your question, huge conversation topic, varying degrees of implementation adoption.
LIZZIE: Later, we’ll hear how GenAI is completely transforming the way some businesses work. But first, what workers really need to know, about what GenAI will change in our jobs. Femi, you spoke to Svenja Gudell, who’s been looking at this in her role as chief economist at Indeed.
FEMI: Exactly—and I began by asking her about the type of changes and trends she’s noticing in her work.
SVENJA: AI is everywhere, right? We have been talking about it nonstop and are actually able to see some of these movements in our data. So we’ve developed a new generative AI tracker that looks at all the different mentions of GenAI inside job postings. It could be either for the creators of GenAI, for example, someone that has to provide a particular prompt or a user of GenAI, a marketing professional that has to be able to deal with these tools. And we saw that over the last two years an 83 X increase in those mentions. But we’re still only about two out of every thousand jobs mentioning some sort of GenAI term—so, still early days here.
FEMI: Svenja, you are in a position to see trends across different economies in different parts of the world. What are you seeing?
SVENJA: They’re looking at what types of frameworks do we need to have in place in order for GenAI to be successful in a given economy, right? Do you need certain digitization to have happened already? What does the educational system look like? What other supports pillars do you need in order to make sure that GenAI can be used for good and have a productive impact in emerging economies versus fully developed economies? So, there are a lot of conversations happening with that. And I think [we’ve] made great strides in terms of providing access to a lot of people. But how as a world, can we make sure that no one is left behind? So, the basic needs are met in order to have GenAI be a tool that can be productive in a bunch of different settings.
FEMI: So, what kind of tasks can GenAI help most with?
SVENJA: It really helps to understand first what skills are being impacted, because a job really is a collection of skills and tasks that you perform, and GenAI is quite good at the technical knowledge—having a bunch of information gathered across really the entire web and everywhere else it can access this knowledge. So, quite good at that. Not so great at problem-solving skills, like leadership skills, empathy, creative problem-solving. And the results were very mixed when looking at all skills and the need for physical execution, actually being physically present. Sometimes GenAI does really well, because you’re coding, for example, you can do that remotely, right? It doesn’t require physical presence. However, if you’re taking blood, you’re a nurse, having an actual physical presence there is really important. So, there GenAI doesn’t do all that well. So, I think the really important thing is, as you figure out what is GenAI good at, and what does that mean for me, I always think, it’s not that GenAI will take your job, right? It’s the person that knows how to use the tools that’s probably going to take your job. So, get in there, go figure out how to use these tools to your best advantage, and see how you can be a more productive version of yourself.
FEMI: Svenja, we’ve been discussing AI as helping us do our work better, and what additional tools can it bring to our work. But is there a way that GenAI could actually create new kinds of services and new kinds of work?
SVENJA: Absolutely. To me, GenAI is a game changer, just like with the computer, which was also a game changer and fully introduced new jobs out there. I don’t think, at least with current data, that GenAI is going to wipe out whole jobs. It will, however, create new jobs, right? The prompt engineer, for example, is a pretty new job out there. Of course, some aspects of jobs will become obsolete. That’s normal. That happens as part of any transition in the labor market. But I think you have to be a bit of a dreamer, right? A bit of an optimist to see what are the cool things that could actually happen with this. And I think we’re starting to see some of these things happen, and in real life, already. In farming, this technology, where you have image detection of weeds in a field that happens [in] real time. And then a laser goes in and zaps the weeds in the field as the machine drives through the field. And that takes a ton of AI. And it’s just amazing, right? And I think it will become incredibly powerful when you start to combine the thought of self, if you will, of GenAI with the actual machine, the automation part of things, right? If we can have robots be smart thinkers and react to certain things with the help of GenAI, I think the possibilities will be amazing in terms of what we can do. And I’m pretty optimistic that we’re onto something here [laughs]. We’ll see some really cool applications, and it’s still incredibly early to see a lot of that.
FEMI: GenAI is supposed to help us save time, be more productive. But what could be the challenges to this in the workplace?SVENJA: We talk about GenAI as being an incredible timesaver at first and can start to help us do anything really fast. And there is a distinct learning curve here, right? There is: You have to actually understand how to use this tool. You have to make sure there are no hallucinations in the answer, meaning you’re not getting made-up things back from the tool. And I think that’s really important to recognize. There is a training curve, and you’re going to have to learn a whole lot of stuff—how to interact with these and how to most properly use them before you can actually start to save a whole bunch of time. And that’s normal. That’s always the case for new tools.
FEMI: So, if you were going to advise somebody who’s looking for new work opportunities in the job market, what would you tell them about GenAI?
SVENJA: First and foremost, I feel like people should always be passionate about the job that they do, right? So, I know it’s always my first answer: find something that you love to do, because that’s going to help you stick with it, right? But then, given the fact that currently GenAI is not whole slate replacing anything quite yet. I think it’s really important to choose a job that you think you want to do, for which there’s good demand out there, right? And then learn the tools that will actually help you be successful in that job. So, if you’re an economist, I would strongly encourage you to start to learn how to code things and how to work with large datasets. Maybe you want to learn some large language models and how to work with those in order to do a fairly detailed research on whatever topic you’re getting into. So I think all these things are really important. Know the tools, know the technology and how you can use it to actually get to your goals faster. And if you take a step back for a moment and look really big picture, if you look at where we are in the US and many other industrialized countries around the world, we’re facing a bit of a demographic cliff. Our labor force is going to start shrinking because our populations are getting older. And that means we’re going to start feeling the crunch in terms of workers very soon. So, workers are going to be in demand. So you can think about healthcare being a really large sector that’s going to continually demand new workers. And then, how can you use these tools to be able to make you even more productive in that setting?FEMI: I’m thinking about policymakers who are listening to our conversation right now and listening to the changing work landscape. What recommendations would you give to them regarding GenAI in the workplace?SVENJA: Policymakers have a pretty tricky job. They have to figure out what should be regulated. Can it be regulated? Does it need to actually be regulated? And, especially for policymakers—although I’ll say a lot of companies are thinking about this as well, of course—the side-effects of GenAI are really important to consider, right? There are certain biases that are inherent in our data, and we train our models on. So how do you make sure that these biases aren’t carried forward? So they’ll have ethical considerations to be paid attention to. You want to make sure that no one is left behind in this advancement. Does everyone have access to this technology? What does it mean for workforce training? What kind of government support does there need to be in order to have successful upskilling, reskilling, to actually have workers fully embrace this type of technology? So I think there are a lot of open questions.FEMI: Svenja, what can businesses, government, even different societies around the world learn from one another about how this technology is being implemented and what its impact will be?SVENJA: If you look at a lot of industrialized countries, of course, the skills are similar that are needed to do different jobs. So there, the labor market impact will be quite similar, but the adoption rate can differ quite a bit. So, we actually just did a study and looked at results for Japan versus the US. And we found that while in the US there’s a bunch of anxiety around AI, right?—a lot of people are still iffy on what does this actually mean? What does it mean for me? What’s going to change? In Japan, survey respondents actually were much more optimistic and much more open to figuring out, OK, how might we adopt this? Well, how can we use it? Even though they’re not actually using these tools as extensively quite yet. I think the US is showing a lot more adoption on these tools so far. So there are different speeds of adoption that we’re starting to notice and different cultural bends in terms of, you know, how open are you to incorporating this? ’Cause you know, change is hard. And that’s one really interesting thing that’s starting to pop out in the data, and we’re closely watching.FEMI: Svenja, thank you.SVENJA: Thank you so much for having me. It was a pleasure.LIZZIE: Pete, you recently collaborated with the World Economic Forum for their report on GenAI for job augmentation and productivity. You talked to some 20 organizations about the lessons that can be learned from the early adopters of GenAI. What are some examples of how this tech is being used by various organizations?
PETE: Many organizations have lots of policies and procedures, and, historically, I think it’s quite tiresome the way people interact with those who understand how stuff gets done. Some organizations have embraced GenAI based around those policies, actually enabling employees to get much faster answers, more accurate answers, much quicker than before. And I think that does a couple of things: I think it enhances employees’ enjoyment in work and it creates greater efficiencies. Another good example would be, a number of organizations in the whole recruitment space. In the world, there is a fierce competition for those with skills, and we know there’s a shortage of critical skills in the world of work, generally. One of the metrics that many organizations use is the time to hire, how they find the right person, right individual, the use of GenAI in that process, to be able to source more accurately, to find the right talented people in the right part of the world, as fast as possible. And then, as they bring them through the process of recruitment, GenAI and its role in that process has been, I think, truly transformational in terms of shortening that time to get the right critical resources into the organization.
FEMI: So what are businesses divulging to you about where they’re seeing the real gains with this technology, Pete?
PETE: I think, look, one of the things that is consistent with many organizations where they’ve been either piloting or implementing is they’re seeing that it’s starting to do things that used to take weeks and months in a matter of minutes. And often, when you delve into that and look at the kind of activity that’s been undertaken, it’s that, dare I say, mundane stuff, the administrative stuff, the repetitive things that people we know from our surveys don’t enjoy doing. And it’s removing some of that and enabling, I think, much crisper, much more accurate outputs, but clearly not without its risks. You know, there’s the whole issue around the ethics of it, some of the inherent biases, and the fact that it doesn’t always give you the right answer. So, I think that message around the importance of humans in conjunction with the technology—we heard that from just about every single organization we spoke to. And that doesn’t go away.
LIZZIE: Are those the main risks that companies are telling you about? The hallucinations? Spitting out wrong answers? Like, what do companies worry about?
PETE: They certainly worry about those, Lizzie, but I think there’s a number of other things they think about. Human beings fundamentally don’t particularly enjoy change. I think those organizations that have seen the best returns on the investments and the best results are those where they’ve been just really clear and embracing their workforce. We always talk about people-centered change, that people tend to adopt what they’ve helped to create. And, I think, in this world of the introduction of GenAI, it’s no different.
LIZZIE: If you are an organization trying to get buy-in from your workforce, and have them embrace this technology, how do you do that?
PETE: Gosh, we could do a whole podcast…
LIZZIE: [Laughs]…on that very question. People tend to respond less positively to, I think, a top-down directive, in most cases. I think, as human beings, we want to understand what are the benefits of this? What does it mean for me? How’s my work going to change? So I think the whole focus around communications and transparency is key. Secondly, it will impact some jobs. That’s the nature of technology and disruptive innovation. What we are seeing, though, it’s creating new jobs and new opportunities. And, I think, an adage we use a lot, is that you can protect people, but you can’t protect jobs. Jobs will continue to evolve. They always will do.
LIZZIE: If you have AI doing some of this sludge stuff, drafting emails, what have you, how do organizations figure out what to do with their workers if they have new productivity gains?
PETE: That’s a really interesting question, Lizzie, because I think in the early days, we’re probably talking a year ago, those organizations that were adopting at the time, I think actually hadn’t really thought through how are they capturing that capacity that’s being freed up and actually what are they going to do with it? What we’re seeing in some of the organizations that are maybe more mature in their deployment, where they’re moving from those pilots into much more enterprise-wide deployments is, they’ve been very deliberate around A, how they’re capturing that capacity, that value, and B, how they’re then redeploying that into other areas of their business which need those skills and capabilities in play. And, I think, for me, that’s a really good example of in some organizations where we’re seeing the skills-first, skills-based organization approach around that. How do you agilely move your skilled people to the right place at the right time? And as soon as you’ve got GenAI in the mix, it, for me, opens up that skills-first approach.
FEMI: In this GenAI era, Svenja Goodell said, When we’re looking at the kind of skills that are needed in a workforce, leadership skills, communication skills, how do we nurture those kind of skills in a workforce?
PETE: And actually, she’s echoing what I’ve seen. I think leaders in organizations are always short of colleagues with those skills. You listed them. Some people call them soft skills. I don’t. I call them human skills. How do organizations engender that? Well, I think there’s a variety of approaches. I think one is having a culture which has a growth mindset, which empowers the workers to develop themselves. It provides opportunities for them to upskill and to reskill. So we know workers want that opportunity to develop and have opportunity to learn new skills. On the opposite side, when you ask the workers the same question, but, does your employer give you that opportunity? Only 40% of workers say they work in an organization that they feel they’re getting full and free access to skilling and development opportunity.
LIZZIE: When we talk about a big societal shift, there is a risk of creating losers as well as winners. And so, when you think about skills and the workforce, what should policymakers be thinking about to provide that support where it’s needed?
PETE: I think the role of policymakers in all this is crucial. I think it’s very easy as well for us to talk about GenAI as if it’s mainstream. Well, we’re fortunate and privileged enough that we have access. We have the software, the hardware, to be able to access it. That’s not the case for everybody around the world. So, creating that equality of opportunity to be able to work with GenAI to learn the skills that are required.
LIZZIE: What do you say to organizations that want to integrate AI but haven’t started yet?
PETE: Work out which elements of the processes within your organization are those that are pretty repeatable processes. Things that lends itself to the implementation of GenAI. I think, secondly, being clear about what it is you’re expecting to see as the outcome and measuring your progress throughout that. I think, thirdly, it’s being transparent and clear about the what and the why with your workers and your employee base. Create that narrative, and engage them on that journey. And, I think, organizations, the ones we’ve spoken to where they started in that way, they’ve been able to actually scale much faster, because they’ve been learning all the way through in the smaller pilots, which they’re able to then scale going forward.
FEMI: If you could look back in five years from now, so we’re in 2030, you look back at what AI has done for workforces around the world, what would be your top three positive changes, do you think?
PETE: What a question Femi! I think, one, I think the whole makeup of the workforce will be different, as historically it has been. But I think we will see the emergence of and probably embedding of much more, what I call, digital workers working very closely with human workers. So we—I think we will see the embedding of digital workers in workforces across most sectors.
LIZZIE: Femi, that was completely fascinating to listen to, because I came away with, kind of, two overriding thoughts. Number one, workers need to be brought on board. There needs to be ownership and enjoyment of these tools. And number two, from Svenja, that these are tools, that they’re not wholesale replacements for people, but something that we’re just going to learn how to use.
FEMI: And also, it’s fast, so get ready. Be ready. Stand by. It’s happening right now.
LIZZIE: Well, that is it for today. Next time, we’re going to be in Switzerland, for the first of two special episodes coming live from Davos, as we hear the latest developments from the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum!

TakeonTomorrow
Generative AI burst onto the scene over two years ago, promising to revolutionize workplace productivity and empower employees to focus on high-impact tasks. But has it lived up to its potential? And can it truly address the productivity challenges facing businesses today?In this episode ofTake on Tomorrow, hosts Lizzie O’Leary and Femi Oke tackle these questions with Svenja Gudell, Chief Economist at the jobs site Indeed, who provides insights into how GenAI is already influencing the labor market and workplace trends. Pete Brown, PwC’s Global Workforce Leader, joins the conversation sharing key findings from a new World Economic Forum and PwC report, highlighting practical strategies for integrating GenAI to boost productivity and support workforce augmentation.With businesses striving to balance innovation and efficiency in a challenging economic climate, this episode is a timely look at how GenAI can help shape the future of work.
SVENJA GUDELL: It’s not that GenAI will take your job, right? It’s the person that knows how to use the tools that’s probably going to take your job.PETE BROWN: You can protect people, but you can’t protect jobs. Jobs will continue to evolve, they always will be.SVENJA: You have to be a bit of a dreamer, right? It’s going to be really amazing if you look into the future to see what could be with this technology.
LIZZIE O’LEARY: Two years ago, it all felt like the world—including our jobs and how we work—would change forever.
FEMI OKE: ChatGPT and other similar GenAI technologies crashed onto the scene, impacting the way we think about everything. From drug discovery to how we communicate.
LIZZIE: Now, more than two years later, how is it changing how businesses run? And how can organizations roll out the technology to create a real impact—helping workers become more productive along the way?
LIZZIE: From PwC’s management publication, strategy and business, this is Take on Tomorrow. I’m Lizzie O’Leary, a podcaster and journalist…
FEMI: …and I’m Femi Oke, a broadcaster and journalist. This week: how is GenAI transforming the job market? Today, we’ll be talking to Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Indeed, a global job site. She’s been looking into how GenAI is transforming the workforce.
LIZZIE: First, we have PwC’s Global Workforce Leader Pete Brown with us to talk about what we can learn from companies considered “early adopters” of GenAI. Welcome back to the show, Pete.
PETE: Thank you, Lizzie, thank you, Femi. It’s lovely to see you.
LIZZIE: Pete, we have talked about GenAI in the workforce and workplace on this show before. But what is the conversation that is happening today in companies? Are they eager to embrace this technology?
PETE: As I reflect through probably every single conversation I’ve had with a client in the last year, and I, dare I say, if I added all my colleagues at PwC as well, I don’t think I’ve had any conversation where the words GenAI haven’t come up. Does that mean they want to embrace it? I think it depends on the organization. Some are and some are yet to start, but it’s certainly sparked huge curiosity and interest. There’s no doubt. What was really surprising to me, though, against that backdrop and this tsunami of interest, is that we survey workers every year just to work out what’s on their mind, what’s motivating them in the world of work. And only 12% of workers say they’re using GenAI in their day-to-day work. That was a surprisingly low number for me. So, I think, to answer your question, huge conversation topic, varying degrees of implementation adoption.
LIZZIE: Later, we’ll hear how GenAI is completely transforming the way some businesses work. But first, what workers really need to know, about what GenAI will change in our jobs. Femi, you spoke to Svenja Gudell, who’s been looking at this in her role as chief economist at Indeed.
FEMI: Exactly—and I began by asking her about the type of changes and trends she’s noticing in her work.
SVENJA: AI is everywhere, right? We have been talking about it nonstop and are actually able to see some of these movements in our data. So we’ve developed a new generative AI tracker that looks at all the different mentions of GenAI inside job postings. It could be either for the creators of GenAI, for example, someone that has to provide a particular prompt or a user of GenAI, a marketing professional that has to be able to deal with these tools. And we saw that over the last two years an 83 X increase in those mentions. But we’re still only about two out of every thousand jobs mentioning some sort of GenAI term—so, still early days here.
FEMI: Svenja, you are in a position to see trends across different economies in different parts of the world. What are you seeing?
SVENJA: They’re looking at what types of frameworks do we need to have in place in order for GenAI to be successful in a given economy, right? Do you need certain digitization to have happened already? What does the educational system look like? What other supports pillars do you need in order to make sure that GenAI can be used for good and have a productive impact in emerging economies versus fully developed economies? So, there are a lot of conversations happening with that. And I think [we’ve] made great strides in terms of providing access to a lot of people. But how as a world, can we make sure that no one is left behind? So, the basic needs are met in order to have GenAI be a tool that can be productive in a bunch of different settings.
FEMI: So, what kind of tasks can GenAI help most with?
SVENJA: It really helps to understand first what skills are being impacted, because a job really is a collection of skills and tasks that you perform, and GenAI is quite good at the technical knowledge—having a bunch of information gathered across really the entire web and everywhere else it can access this knowledge. So, quite good at that. Not so great at problem-solving skills, like leadership skills, empathy, creative problem-solving. And the results were very mixed when looking at all skills and the need for physical execution, actually being physically present. Sometimes GenAI does really well, because you’re coding, for example, you can do that remotely, right? It doesn’t require physical presence. However, if you’re taking blood, you’re a nurse, having an actual physical presence there is really important. So, there GenAI doesn’t do all that well. So, I think the really important thing is, as you figure out what is GenAI good at, and what does that mean for me, I always think, it’s not that GenAI will take your job, right? It’s the person that knows how to use the tools that’s probably going to take your job. So, get in there, go figure out how to use these tools to your best advantage, and see how you can be a more productive version of yourself.
FEMI: Svenja, we’ve been discussing AI as helping us do our work better, and what additional tools can it bring to our work. But is there a way that GenAI could actually create new kinds of services and new kinds of work?
SVENJA: Absolutely. To me, GenAI is a game changer, just like with the computer, which was also a game changer and fully introduced new jobs out there. I don’t think, at least with current data, that GenAI is going to wipe out whole jobs. It will, however, create new jobs, right? The prompt engineer, for example, is a pretty new job out there. Of course, some aspects of jobs will become obsolete. That’s normal. That happens as part of any transition in the labor market. But I think you have to be a bit of a dreamer, right? A bit of an optimist to see what are the cool things that could actually happen with this. And I think we’re starting to see some of these things happen, and in real life, already. In farming, this technology, where you have image detection of weeds in a field that happens [in] real time. And then a laser goes in and zaps the weeds in the field as the machine drives through the field. And that takes a ton of AI. And it’s just amazing, right? And I think it will become incredibly powerful when you start to combine the thought of self, if you will, of GenAI with the actual machine, the automation part of things, right? If we can have robots be smart thinkers and react to certain things with the help of GenAI, I think the possibilities will be amazing in terms of what we can do. And I’m pretty optimistic that we’re onto something here [laughs]. We’ll see some really cool applications, and it’s still incredibly early to see a lot of that.
FEMI: GenAI is supposed to help us save time, be more productive. But what could be the challenges to this in the workplace?SVENJA: We talk about GenAI as being an incredible timesaver at first and can start to help us do anything really fast. And there is a distinct learning curve here, right? There is: You have to actually understand how to use this tool. You have to make sure there are no hallucinations in the answer, meaning you’re not getting made-up things back from the tool. And I think that’s really important to recognize. There is a training curve, and you’re going to have to learn a whole lot of stuff—how to interact with these and how to most properly use them before you can actually start to save a whole bunch of time. And that’s normal. That’s always the case for new tools.
FEMI: So, if you were going to advise somebody who’s looking for new work opportunities in the job market, what would you tell them about GenAI?
SVENJA: First and foremost, I feel like people should always be passionate about the job that they do, right? So, I know it’s always my first answer: find something that you love to do, because that’s going to help you stick with it, right? But then, given the fact that currently GenAI is not whole slate replacing anything quite yet. I think it’s really important to choose a job that you think you want to do, for which there’s good demand out there, right? And then learn the tools that will actually help you be successful in that job. So, if you’re an economist, I would strongly encourage you to start to learn how to code things and how to work with large datasets. Maybe you want to learn some large language models and how to work with those in order to do a fairly detailed research on whatever topic you’re getting into. So I think all these things are really important. Know the tools, know the technology and how you can use it to actually get to your goals faster. And if you take a step back for a moment and look really big picture, if you look at where we are in the US and many other industrialized countries around the world, we’re facing a bit of a demographic cliff. Our labor force is going to start shrinking because our populations are getting older. And that means we’re going to start feeling the crunch in terms of workers very soon. So, workers are going to be in demand. So you can think about healthcare being a really large sector that’s going to continually demand new workers. And then, how can you use these tools to be able to make you even more productive in that setting?FEMI: I’m thinking about policymakers who are listening to our conversation right now and listening to the changing work landscape. What recommendations would you give to them regarding GenAI in the workplace?SVENJA: Policymakers have a pretty tricky job. They have to figure out what should be regulated. Can it be regulated? Does it need to actually be regulated? And, especially for policymakers—although I’ll say a lot of companies are thinking about this as well, of course—the side-effects of GenAI are really important to consider, right? There are certain biases that are inherent in our data, and we train our models on. So how do you make sure that these biases aren’t carried forward? So they’ll have ethical considerations to be paid attention to. You want to make sure that no one is left behind in this advancement. Does everyone have access to this technology? What does it mean for workforce training? What kind of government support does there need to be in order to have successful upskilling, reskilling, to actually have workers fully embrace this type of technology? So I think there are a lot of open questions.FEMI: Svenja, what can businesses, government, even different societies around the world learn from one another about how this technology is being implemented and what its impact will be?SVENJA: If you look at a lot of industrialized countries, of course, the skills are similar that are needed to do different jobs. So there, the labor market impact will be quite similar, but the adoption rate can differ quite a bit. So, we actually just did a study and looked at results for Japan versus the US. And we found that while in the US there’s a bunch of anxiety around AI, right?—a lot of people are still iffy on what does this actually mean? What does it mean for me? What’s going to change? In Japan, survey respondents actually were much more optimistic and much more open to figuring out, OK, how might we adopt this? Well, how can we use it? Even though they’re not actually using these tools as extensively quite yet. I think the US is showing a lot more adoption on these tools so far. So there are different speeds of adoption that we’re starting to notice and different cultural bends in terms of, you know, how open are you to incorporating this? ’Cause you know, change is hard. And that’s one really interesting thing that’s starting to pop out in the data, and we’re closely watching.FEMI: Svenja, thank you.SVENJA: Thank you so much for having me. It was a pleasure.LIZZIE: Pete, you recently collaborated with the World Economic Forum for their report on GenAI for job augmentation and productivity. You talked to some 20 organizations about the lessons that can be learned from the early adopters of GenAI. What are some examples of how this tech is being used by various organizations?
PETE: Many organizations have lots of policies and procedures, and, historically, I think it’s quite tiresome the way people interact with those who understand how stuff gets done. Some organizations have embraced GenAI based around those policies, actually enabling employees to get much faster answers, more accurate answers, much quicker than before. And I think that does a couple of things: I think it enhances employees’ enjoyment in work and it creates greater efficiencies. Another good example would be, a number of organizations in the whole recruitment space. In the world, there is a fierce competition for those with skills, and we know there’s a shortage of critical skills in the world of work, generally. One of the metrics that many organizations use is the time to hire, how they find the right person, right individual, the use of GenAI in that process, to be able to source more accurately, to find the right talented people in the right part of the world, as fast as possible. And then, as they bring them through the process of recruitment, GenAI and its role in that process has been, I think, truly transformational in terms of shortening that time to get the right critical resources into the organization.
FEMI: So what are businesses divulging to you about where they’re seeing the real gains with this technology, Pete?
PETE: I think, look, one of the things that is consistent with many organizations where they’ve been either piloting or implementing is they’re seeing that it’s starting to do things that used to take weeks and months in a matter of minutes. And often, when you delve into that and look at the kind of activity that’s been undertaken, it’s that, dare I say, mundane stuff, the administrative stuff, the repetitive things that people we know from our surveys don’t enjoy doing. And it’s removing some of that and enabling, I think, much crisper, much more accurate outputs, but clearly not without its risks. You know, there’s the whole issue around the ethics of it, some of the inherent biases, and the fact that it doesn’t always give you the right answer. So, I think that message around the importance of humans in conjunction with the technology—we heard that from just about every single organization we spoke to. And that doesn’t go away.
LIZZIE: Are those the main risks that companies are telling you about? The hallucinations? Spitting out wrong answers? Like, what do companies worry about?
PETE: They certainly worry about those, Lizzie, but I think there’s a number of other things they think about. Human beings fundamentally don’t particularly enjoy change. I think those organizations that have seen the best returns on the investments and the best results are those where they’ve been just really clear and embracing their workforce. We always talk about people-centered change, that people tend to adopt what they’ve helped to create. And, I think, in this world of the introduction of GenAI, it’s no different.
LIZZIE: If you are an organization trying to get buy-in from your workforce, and have them embrace this technology, how do you do that?
PETE: Gosh, we could do a whole podcast…
LIZZIE: [Laughs]…on that very question. People tend to respond less positively to, I think, a top-down directive, in most cases. I think, as human beings, we want to understand what are the benefits of this? What does it mean for me? How’s my work going to change? So I think the whole focus around communications and transparency is key. Secondly, it will impact some jobs. That’s the nature of technology and disruptive innovation. What we are seeing, though, it’s creating new jobs and new opportunities. And, I think, an adage we use a lot, is that you can protect people, but you can’t protect jobs. Jobs will continue to evolve. They always will do.
LIZZIE: If you have AI doing some of this sludge stuff, drafting emails, what have you, how do organizations figure out what to do with their workers if they have new productivity gains?
PETE: That’s a really interesting question, Lizzie, because I think in the early days, we’re probably talking a year ago, those organizations that were adopting at the time, I think actually hadn’t really thought through how are they capturing that capacity that’s being freed up and actually what are they going to do with it? What we’re seeing in some of the organizations that are maybe more mature in their deployment, where they’re moving from those pilots into much more enterprise-wide deployments is, they’ve been very deliberate around A, how they’re capturing that capacity, that value, and B, how they’re then redeploying that into other areas of their business which need those skills and capabilities in play. And, I think, for me, that’s a really good example of in some organizations where we’re seeing the skills-first, skills-based organization approach around that. How do you agilely move your skilled people to the right place at the right time? And as soon as you’ve got GenAI in the mix, it, for me, opens up that skills-first approach.
FEMI: In this GenAI era, Svenja Goodell said, When we’re looking at the kind of skills that are needed in a workforce, leadership skills, communication skills, how do we nurture those kind of skills in a workforce?
PETE: And actually, she’s echoing what I’ve seen. I think leaders in organizations are always short of colleagues with those skills. You listed them. Some people call them soft skills. I don’t. I call them human skills. How do organizations engender that? Well, I think there’s a variety of approaches. I think one is having a culture which has a growth mindset, which empowers the workers to develop themselves. It provides opportunities for them to upskill and to reskill. So we know workers want that opportunity to develop and have opportunity to learn new skills. On the opposite side, when you ask the workers the same question, but, does your employer give you that opportunity? Only 40% of workers say they work in an organization that they feel they’re getting full and free access to skilling and development opportunity.
LIZZIE: When we talk about a big societal shift, there is a risk of creating losers as well as winners. And so, when you think about skills and the workforce, what should policymakers be thinking about to provide that support where it’s needed?
PETE: I think the role of policymakers in all this is crucial. I think it’s very easy as well for us to talk about GenAI as if it’s mainstream. Well, we’re fortunate and privileged enough that we have access. We have the software, the hardware, to be able to access it. That’s not the case for everybody around the world. So, creating that equality of opportunity to be able to work with GenAI to learn the skills that are required.
LIZZIE: What do you say to organizations that want to integrate AI but haven’t started yet?
PETE: Work out which elements of the processes within your organization are those that are pretty repeatable processes. Things that lends itself to the implementation of GenAI. I think, secondly, being clear about what it is you’re expecting to see as the outcome and measuring your progress throughout that. I think, thirdly, it’s being transparent and clear about the what and the why with your workers and your employee base. Create that narrative, and engage them on that journey. And, I think, organizations, the ones we’ve spoken to where they started in that way, they’ve been able to actually scale much faster, because they’ve been learning all the way through in the smaller pilots, which they’re able to then scale going forward.
FEMI: If you could look back in five years from now, so we’re in 2030, you look back at what AI has done for workforces around the world, what would be your top three positive changes, do you think?
PETE: What a question Femi! I think, one, I think the whole makeup of the workforce will be different, as historically it has been. But I think we will see the emergence of and probably embedding of much more, what I call, digital workers working very closely with human workers. So we—I think we will see the embedding of digital workers in workforces across most sectors.
LIZZIE: Femi, that was completely fascinating to listen to, because I came away with, kind of, two overriding thoughts. Number one, workers need to be brought on board. There needs to be ownership and enjoyment of these tools. And number two, from Svenja, that these are tools, that they’re not wholesale replacements for people, but something that we’re just going to learn how to use.
FEMI: And also, it’s fast, so get ready. Be ready. Stand by. It’s happening right now.
LIZZIE: Well, that is it for today. Next time, we’re going to be in Switzerland, for the first of two special episodes coming live from Davos, as we hear the latest developments from the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum!

Emerge stronger through disruption podcastPodcast, PwC United StatesDecember 2024
See all episodes
PwC’s GCCR co-leaders Dave and Bobbie reflect on the major disruptions and the evolving regulatory landscape of 2024 and explore how to build resilience for 2025.
Release date: December 2024
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Hi everyone, and welcome to the Emerge Stronger Through Disruption podcast series. I'm Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles, co-leader of PwC’s Global Centre for Crisis and Resilience, or GCCR for short. And I'm coming to you from our office in London. I'm also joined by Dave Stainback, my GCCR co-leader. Great to be here with you as always, Dave.
David Stainback:Thanks, Bobbie and hello everyone. The aim of this podcast series is to explore the challenges facing businesses in this environment of constant crisis and change and discuss how successful business leaders can emerge stronger through disruption. In our last episode, we focused on the topic of measuring and reporting enterprise resilience maturity.
What's on our agenda today, Bobbie?
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Yeah, so look, today we're gonna reflect a little bit on the major disruptions that we've seen this year, and also importantly the regulatory shifts we've seen. And then I think it'd be great actually to start sharing some predictions, Dave, as we head in towards 2025.
David Stainback:That sounds great. Let's dive in. So I think we can all agree that 2024 was a year marked by significant disruptions. Many of these were due to either tech outages or cyber-attacks on key third party technology providers or software companies that really serve large ecosystems of businesses. One of the most notable was the major IT outages in July of this year, which downed millions of machines globally disrupting operations across nearly every industry.
And it just shows how in today's connected world, a simple software upgrade can cause massive impacts with combined losses, potentially totaling billions of dollars.
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Absolutely Dave. And look, I think this year has been challenging in many ways for organisations and we publisheda point of viewin the last few months around that, and we can absolutely include a link to that as well today.
But there's also been disruption from AI generated misinformation and disinformation, and that's caused widespread confusion and impacted business operations. And look, we've also seen extreme weather events, certainly in the UK very recently, but also we've seen heat waves across markets, droughts, wildfires, flooding, and it's all gonna continue to increase.
And what it really does is impact supply chains.
David Stainback:Yeah and we also saw societal and political polarisation creating fragile environments for businesses, and this affected those global supply chains, operational continuity and market stability with industries like technology and manufacturing being hit particularly hard.
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Yeah, exactly. And I think it's been a big year, but let's not forget that actually during disruption there's also opportunity, right? So I was speaking to an online auction technology platform recently and they were talking about the fact that when supply chains are disrupted, actually demands spikes for them as customers shift to second hangers.
So there's absolutely opportunity in this disruption as well. And also what's been really interesting I think this year is we've seen some key regulatory shifts aimed at enhancing Operational Resilience (OpRes) and that's impacting organisations across all different markets. And you know, we had aseparate podcastrecently focusing on that very topic, but actually why don't we just recap on a few key points around that, Dave?
David Stainback: Sure Bobbie, so there's a lot happening in that space for sure. And let's cover quickly a few of them now. You can take the EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act, or DORA, for example. It's the European framework that focuses on embedding a more robust and resilient approach to delivering digital capabilities, primarily focused on financial entities and organisations deemed as critical third-party providers. We're now just a month away from the compliance date of January 17th, 2025. In addition, the Financial Conduct Authority, Bank of England, and Prudential Regulation Authority recently introduced new rules that align closely with international standards, similar to DORA as well.
The Critical Entity's Resilience Directive or CERD is another key EU regulation that has implications on many businesses. As it applies to organisations across 11 key sectors, including energy, transport, healthcare, and digital infrastructure. In Australia, the Prudential Regulation Authority has introduced CPS 230, which aims to strengthen the way operational risk is managed by, again, the financial services sector there.
And in the US there's been a ton of heavy push as OpRes has been really moving up the list of regulatory priorities. So we can keep going on and on here, but I think you get the idea that this is a clear global trend coming out of 2024.
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Yeah, 100% Dave. And I think we are seeing regulation relating to Operational Resilience coming across all markets and all sectors and not just financial services. Right?
And these regulatory changes have an increased compliance costs, of course, but actually it creates opportunity for innovation and competitor advantage as well. I think businesses have had to enhance their focus on risk management and contingency planning. But what we're also seeing is that it's leading to actually greater collaboration between the public and private sectors as well to address that global risk.
David Stainback:Yea, great point there, Bobbie. Do you have any examples to share for our listeners on that point?
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Yeah, absolutely. So I'm due to join a briefing on a panel in January in the UK, all around the topic of regulation around resilience, and it comes off the back of a report called Regulating for Resilience, which looks at the necessity of how to evolve regulatory frameworks and identifies four key problems around prioritisation, boundaries, time and emergence, and the fact that that requires an integrated regulatory approach.
And what we're looking at is the recommendations around three new elements, and this is for the UK, I should say:a national body for governance, a system-wide overview map, and polycentric regulatory systems.
And the whole aim of this is actually to enhance the resilience of critical national infrastructure by fostering a whole system approach to resilience, which hopefully with the aim enables preparedness, but also adaptability in the face of these internetconnected risks. So I think it's gonna be a really interesting start to the year in the UK when we have this breakfast and start to look at how are we gonna regulate resilience in the UK market.
David Stainback:It is. It's really interesting, and it's true that we as a society rely upon social, physical, digital, and natural infrastructures that all too often we take for granted until they fail. As our society becomes increasingly complex and interconnected, interdependent, the regulatory frameworks, they have to evolve accordingly.
And I think that's part of the reason we're seeing more comprehensive regulations in this space. So now that we've reflected on what happened this year, shall we shift gears a little and talk about what's to come in the new year as we approach 2025?
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Yeah, absolutely. Let's do that. So looking ahead to 2025, I think there's a few key trends we can expect.
Firstly, I think it goes without saying that disruption is going to continue. We're gonna likely see disruption that is quicker, more widespread, but also I think. the risks that organisations face are far more interconnected than they've ever been. If you take, for example, technology and Gen AI, you know, that's clearly there's huge opportunity for organisations, but that also brings risk that needs to be managed.
And then we've got digital transformation. Many organisations are continuing to go through that transformation, and cybersecurity remains a key risk as well. So organisations need to continue to manage those risks. Inflation remains high, and we could see a range of impacts for business from that. And clearly the focus on sustainability will continue and we're gonna do a podcast next year, which looks at the interplay between climate risk, sustainability, and resilience, which I think will be fantastic.
Second, as already mentioned, we're gonna see a continued focus on resilience regulation. We've got a number of key dates coming in, as all of you will be very familiar with. We've got DORA coming into full effect by January. We've got the UK financial institutions deadline set for March 31st, and also we've got NIS2 coming in, which is requiring member states to establish a list of essential and important entities by April ‘25.
And then finally I think we'll see a trend in which more and more organisations have to take a holistic approach to building resilience and building it top down across the enterprise. And with more disruptions and regulation, I think it's essential that organisations really start to focus on protecting what matters most to them.
And doing that by integrating their different resilience capabilities and putting the right governance in place to be able to do that, both so that they can transform their business, but also gain that competitive advantage that we talked about earlier.
David Stainback:All great points, Bobbie, and honestly, I agree with all of them in terms of trends going forward and kind of building onto your last point, if I might add for our listeners just a little bit about what we think organisations can do to prepare for some of these upcoming trends.
I think you know, number one, it's engaging in proactive risk management and scenario planning, being more thoughtful around severe, but plausible disruptions, applying them to your business, to your industry, etc. is really something that needs to pick up as you enhance your risk management programs.
Secondly, measuring current enterprise resilience capabilities of your own organisation and tracking them regularly. It's prudent to understand how your resilience capabilities stack up today, and then monitor their maturity as you continue to invest. It's important both to Board and customer confidence, but it will also help with readiness for regulatory compliance with the litany of things that we've mentioned to date.
Thirdly, I would say build resilience for strategic reasons, and not for compliance reasons. The myriad of regulations are gonna become harder and harder to keep up with anyway. And we have seen over and over again that simply performing check the box compliance resilience steps rarely actually help organisations when true disruption hits.
So truly building your programme with effective resilience in mind is critical. And if you do, you'll most importantly be ready for when disruption hits. And frankly, the ability to meet any future regulations will naturally follow from there.
Fourthly, invest proactively in building resilience with the help of technology and AI. Technology makes managing resilience easier, get out of paper, right?
There's a lot of different tools and platforms out there that make this something that can become a living and breathing programme and AI, it’s gonna have a powerful use case around scenario planning as well as frankly, assessing impacts rapidly within your own organisation that we're already seeing leading firms begin to leverage today.
And lastly, if you don't mind, I'd like to give one final prediction for 2025. I wonder if we may see an increasing need for a Chief Resilience Officer. In ourGlobal Crisis and Resilience Survey from 2023, our respondents highlighted that need for a responsible party for the overall resilience programme, and it goes to the governance you talked about Bobbie.
And yet the reality was at the time, many organisations lacked that dedicated role with that responsibility for the whole programme. And I think it was only 10% of organisations had at the time appointed a Chief Resilience Officer. So I think it's gonna be interesting to see if we're gonna see an upward tick or an upward trend in this over the coming year, as more and more businesses realise the need and the benefit of having that type of a role.
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Brilliant. Dave. I absolutely agree. I think that the whole role as the Chief Resilience Officer is really gonna come into focus next year across different sectors, but I think that's a really great place to wrap up.
Thanks as always, Dave, for a great discussion and also to all of our listeners for tuning in. It was brilliant today to take the opportunity to both reflect on what's happened this year, and also what we can and might expect for next year.
David Stainback:Thank you, Bobbie. It's clear that staying informed and proactive in managing risks and building resilience, it's more important than ever.
So in upcoming episodes of Emerge Stronger Through Disruption we’ll continue to tackle the topics that keep business leaders up at night, and we'd love to hear ideas from those leaders and from our listeners about topics you'd like us to address. So please get in touch with both Bobbie and me via LinkedIn.
And in the meantime, remember to subscribe to Emerge Stronger Through Disruption wherever you get your podcasts. Thanks for listening. Have a lovely holiday season and we'll see you next year.

I'm Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles, co-leader of PwC’s Global Centre for Crisis and Resilience, or GCCR for short. And I'm coming to you from our office in London. I'm also joined by Dave Stainback, my GCCR co-leader. Great to be here with you as always, Dave.
David Stainback:Thanks, Bobbie and hello everyone. The aim of this podcast series is to explore the challenges facing businesses in this environment of constant crisis and change and discuss how successful business leaders can emerge stronger through disruption. In our last episode, we focused on the topic of measuring and reporting enterprise resilience maturity.
What's on our agenda today, Bobbie?
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Yeah, so look, today we're gonna reflect a little bit on the major disruptions that we've seen this year, and also importantly the regulatory shifts we've seen. And then I think it'd be great actually to start sharing some predictions, Dave, as we head in towards 2025.
David Stainback:That sounds great. Let's dive in. So I think we can all agree that 2024 was a year marked by significant disruptions. Many of these were due to either tech outages or cyber-attacks on key third party technology providers or software companies that really serve large ecosystems of businesses. One of the most notable was the major IT outages in July of this year, which downed millions of machines globally disrupting operations across nearly every industry.
And it just shows how in today's connected world, a simple software upgrade can cause massive impacts with combined losses, potentially totaling billions of dollars.
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Absolutely Dave. And look, I think this year has been challenging in many ways for organisations and we publisheda point of viewin the last few months around that, and we can absolutely include a link to that as well today.
But there's also been disruption from AI generated misinformation and disinformation, and that's caused widespread confusion and impacted business operations. And look, we've also seen extreme weather events, certainly in the UK very recently, but also we've seen heat waves across markets, droughts, wildfires, flooding, and it's all gonna continue to increase.
And what it really does is impact supply chains.
David Stainback:Yeah and we also saw societal and political polarisation creating fragile environments for businesses, and this affected those global supply chains, operational continuity and market stability with industries like technology and manufacturing being hit particularly hard.
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Yeah, exactly. And I think it's been a big year, but let's not forget that actually during disruption there's also opportunity, right? So I was speaking to an online auction technology platform recently and they were talking about the fact that when supply chains are disrupted, actually demands spikes for them as customers shift to second hangers.
So there's absolutely opportunity in this disruption as well. And also what's been really interesting I think this year is we've seen some key regulatory shifts aimed at enhancing Operational Resilience (OpRes) and that's impacting organisations across all different markets. And you know, we had aseparate podcastrecently focusing on that very topic, but actually why don't we just recap on a few key points around that, Dave?
David Stainback: Sure Bobbie, so there's a lot happening in that space for sure. And let's cover quickly a few of them now. You can take the EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act, or DORA, for example. It's the European framework that focuses on embedding a more robust and resilient approach to delivering digital capabilities, primarily focused on financial entities and organisations deemed as critical third-party providers. We're now just a month away from the compliance date of January 17th, 2025. In addition, the Financial Conduct Authority, Bank of England, and Prudential Regulation Authority recently introduced new rules that align closely with international standards, similar to DORA as well.
The Critical Entity's Resilience Directive or CERD is another key EU regulation that has implications on many businesses. As it applies to organisations across 11 key sectors, including energy, transport, healthcare, and digital infrastructure. In Australia, the Prudential Regulation Authority has introduced CPS 230, which aims to strengthen the way operational risk is managed by, again, the financial services sector there.
And in the US there's been a ton of heavy push as OpRes has been really moving up the list of regulatory priorities. So we can keep going on and on here, but I think you get the idea that this is a clear global trend coming out of 2024.
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Yeah, 100% Dave. And I think we are seeing regulation relating to Operational Resilience coming across all markets and all sectors and not just financial services. Right?
And these regulatory changes have an increased compliance costs, of course, but actually it creates opportunity for innovation and competitor advantage as well. I think businesses have had to enhance their focus on risk management and contingency planning. But what we're also seeing is that it's leading to actually greater collaboration between the public and private sectors as well to address that global risk.
David Stainback:Yea, great point there, Bobbie. Do you have any examples to share for our listeners on that point?
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Yeah, absolutely. So I'm due to join a briefing on a panel in January in the UK, all around the topic of regulation around resilience, and it comes off the back of a report called Regulating for Resilience, which looks at the necessity of how to evolve regulatory frameworks and identifies four key problems around prioritisation, boundaries, time and emergence, and the fact that that requires an integrated regulatory approach.
And what we're looking at is the recommendations around three new elements, and this is for the UK, I should say:a national body for governance, a system-wide overview map, and polycentric regulatory systems.
And the whole aim of this is actually to enhance the resilience of critical national infrastructure by fostering a whole system approach to resilience, which hopefully with the aim enables preparedness, but also adaptability in the face of these internetconnected risks. So I think it's gonna be a really interesting start to the year in the UK when we have this breakfast and start to look at how are we gonna regulate resilience in the UK market.
David Stainback:It is. It's really interesting, and it's true that we as a society rely upon social, physical, digital, and natural infrastructures that all too often we take for granted until they fail. As our society becomes increasingly complex and interconnected, interdependent, the regulatory frameworks, they have to evolve accordingly.
And I think that's part of the reason we're seeing more comprehensive regulations in this space. So now that we've reflected on what happened this year, shall we shift gears a little and talk about what's to come in the new year as we approach 2025?
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Yeah, absolutely. Let's do that. So looking ahead to 2025, I think there's a few key trends we can expect.
Firstly, I think it goes without saying that disruption is going to continue. We're gonna likely see disruption that is quicker, more widespread, but also I think. the risks that organisations face are far more interconnected than they've ever been. If you take, for example, technology and Gen AI, you know, that's clearly there's huge opportunity for organisations, but that also brings risk that needs to be managed.
And then we've got digital transformation. Many organisations are continuing to go through that transformation, and cybersecurity remains a key risk as well. So organisations need to continue to manage those risks. Inflation remains high, and we could see a range of impacts for business from that. And clearly the focus on sustainability will continue and we're gonna do a podcast next year, which looks at the interplay between climate risk, sustainability, and resilience, which I think will be fantastic.
Second, as already mentioned, we're gonna see a continued focus on resilience regulation. We've got a number of key dates coming in, as all of you will be very familiar with. We've got DORA coming into full effect by January. We've got the UK financial institutions deadline set for March 31st, and also we've got NIS2 coming in, which is requiring member states to establish a list of essential and important entities by April ‘25.
And then finally I think we'll see a trend in which more and more organisations have to take a holistic approach to building resilience and building it top down across the enterprise. And with more disruptions and regulation, I think it's essential that organisations really start to focus on protecting what matters most to them.
And doing that by integrating their different resilience capabilities and putting the right governance in place to be able to do that, both so that they can transform their business, but also gain that competitive advantage that we talked about earlier.
David Stainback:All great points, Bobbie, and honestly, I agree with all of them in terms of trends going forward and kind of building onto your last point, if I might add for our listeners just a little bit about what we think organisations can do to prepare for some of these upcoming trends.
I think you know, number one, it's engaging in proactive risk management and scenario planning, being more thoughtful around severe, but plausible disruptions, applying them to your business, to your industry, etc. is really something that needs to pick up as you enhance your risk management programs.
Secondly, measuring current enterprise resilience capabilities of your own organisation and tracking them regularly. It's prudent to understand how your resilience capabilities stack up today, and then monitor their maturity as you continue to invest. It's important both to Board and customer confidence, but it will also help with readiness for regulatory compliance with the litany of things that we've mentioned to date.
Thirdly, I would say build resilience for strategic reasons, and not for compliance reasons. The myriad of regulations are gonna become harder and harder to keep up with anyway. And we have seen over and over again that simply performing check the box compliance resilience steps rarely actually help organisations when true disruption hits.
So truly building your programme with effective resilience in mind is critical. And if you do, you'll most importantly be ready for when disruption hits. And frankly, the ability to meet any future regulations will naturally follow from there.
Fourthly, invest proactively in building resilience with the help of technology and AI. Technology makes managing resilience easier, get out of paper, right?
There's a lot of different tools and platforms out there that make this something that can become a living and breathing programme and AI, it’s gonna have a powerful use case around scenario planning as well as frankly, assessing impacts rapidly within your own organisation that we're already seeing leading firms begin to leverage today.
And lastly, if you don't mind, I'd like to give one final prediction for 2025. I wonder if we may see an increasing need for a Chief Resilience Officer. In ourGlobal Crisis and Resilience Survey from 2023, our respondents highlighted that need for a responsible party for the overall resilience programme, and it goes to the governance you talked about Bobbie.
And yet the reality was at the time, many organisations lacked that dedicated role with that responsibility for the whole programme. And I think it was only 10% of organisations had at the time appointed a Chief Resilience Officer. So I think it's gonna be interesting to see if we're gonna see an upward tick or an upward trend in this over the coming year, as more and more businesses realise the need and the benefit of having that type of a role.
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Brilliant. Dave. I absolutely agree. I think that the whole role as the Chief Resilience Officer is really gonna come into focus next year across different sectors, but I think that's a really great place to wrap up.
Thanks as always, Dave, for a great discussion and also to all of our listeners for tuning in. It was brilliant today to take the opportunity to both reflect on what's happened this year, and also what we can and might expect for next year.
David Stainback:Thank you, Bobbie. It's clear that staying informed and proactive in managing risks and building resilience, it's more important than ever.
So in upcoming episodes of Emerge Stronger Through Disruption we’ll continue to tackle the topics that keep business leaders up at night, and we'd love to hear ideas from those leaders and from our listeners about topics you'd like us to address. So please get in touch with both Bobbie and me via LinkedIn.
And in the meantime, remember to subscribe to Emerge Stronger Through Disruption wherever you get your podcasts. Thanks for listening. Have a lovely holiday season and we'll see you next year.

TakeonTomorrow
Businesses today are under intense pressure to redefine what it means to be responsible. Leaders are tasked with managing environmental impacts, navigating climate change, and building rewarding experiences for employees and customers—all while maintaining financial performance. But how can they achieve these ambitious goals?
In this episode ofTake on Tomorrow, hosts Lizzie O’Leary and Femi Oke dive into this question with venture capital investor and Patagonia Board Chair, Charles Conn, who shares insights from Patagonia’s journey in aligning ethical commitments with commercial demands, offering valuable lessons for other companies. They also talk to Colm Kelly, Global Leader, Corporate Sustainability, for the PwC network, about how the real-world impacts of the climate transition are prompting change and reshaping boardroom priorities.
CHARLES CONN: We can’t do business on a dead planet. There really isn’t a trade-off at the end of the day.
COLM KELLY: The alternative option of business as usual actually isn’t business as usual, because the world around us is changing.
CHARLES: When you stand for something, there will be some people who stand against you. We don’t need that purpose to be one-size-fits-all.
FEMI OKE: From PwC’s management publicationstrategy and business, this isTake on Tomorrow, the podcast that brings together experts from around the globe to figure out what business could and shouldbe doing to tackle some of the biggest issues facing the world.
I’m Femi Oke, a broadcaster and journalist…
LIZZIE O’LEARY: …and I’m Lizzie O'Leary, a podcaster and journalist. Today, what does it take to run a responsible business—that also serves its shareholders?
LIZZIE: Business leaders are facing the ultimate balancing act. They want to be more sustainable. Make money. Keep their shareholders happy. Serve the customer. And the timeline to do all this is becoming shorter and shorter.
FEMI: It’s enough to make anyone’s head spin. So how should business leaders balance the need to make money and be sustainable?
LIZZIE: To find out, we’ll be talking to Charles Conn, the chairman of Patagonia, a company that calls themselves a responsible business.
FEMI: But first, to help us understand the pressures sustainable businesses are facing, we’re joined by Colm Kelly, Global Leader, Corporate Sustainability, for the PwC network. Hi there, Colm.
COLM: Hi there.
LIZZIE: Colm, to get us started, what are companies telling PwC about the way climate change is impacting their businesses right now?
COLM: Well, I think there’s probably three areas. The first is a growing recognition that climate is impacting on the business, on the value chain, on the supply chain. We see lots of issues over the last few years surfacing all over the planet, frankly, in terms of all kinds of weather events which impact on businesses negatively. The second, by definition, is entirely related, which is that businesses are increasingly conscious of the need to respond to that threat by decarbonizing. And I think the third area is where we see the expectation that businesses will be more transparent about reporting on their performance in relation to nonfinancial metrics in the sustainability space. So they’re the three areas that I think businesses are very conscious of.
FEMI: Colm, how are those conversations, those discussions, influencing the way that businesses think about their future?
COLM: Well, I think most businesses which have taken a look at the way in which the climate change challenge is unfolding are figuring out pretty quickly that we’re on a very challenging path, to say the least. And at a minimum, the changes which are already baked in, frankly, are going to, in some cases, have quite material implications for many businesses, never mind our communities and our societies. So you have this general context within which the conversation takes place, which quickly moves then to aso whatquestion. What should business do? What can business do? And how do we get that done?
FEMI: Colm, stay with us. We’ll come back to you soon. But first, Lizzie, you spoke to someone who has been leading the way when it comes to responsible business practices, right?
LIZZIE: Exactly. I was really excited to speak to Charles Conn, the Chair of Patagonia. And I began by asking him about how he got into running sustainable businesses.
CHARLES: My dad was someone who loved the outdoors, and so from as long as I can remember, we were in Maine and Nova Scotia, and I remember vividly looking at pond water under a microscope in third grade and just feeling like that protecting the world was important. But by the same token, I was also trained in, you know, what was called shareholder capitalism, which said externalities aren’t that important. Maximizing shareholder returns is what’s important. And then we’ll let shareholders decide what they give their money to. And I went to fancy business school, and I think what happened over time is you can’t help but notice the little changes that, actually, our own behavior does matter. And I think that gradual raising of consciousness made me a much more activist person around sustainability.
LIZZIE: Well, at Patagonia, you call yourselves a responsible company, not a sustainable company. Can you explain that distinction?
CHARLES: Yeah, we’re not yet a sustainable company. We’re on the journey to being a sustainable company. What we are is responsible, taking full responsibility for everything that goes into making a garment, not saying we run our own shop cleanly. We don’t know where the dyes come from, or where the fabrics come from, or the terrible conditions under which these clothes were actually put together. And that’s where the social and environmental consciousness of Patagonia comes from.
LIZZIE: You mentioned this journey, right? The company’s journey, and I think it’s fair to say that one of the biggest parts of that is the decision by founder Yvon Chouinard in 2022 to transfer ownership of Patagonia into what’s called a purpose trust, where the beneficiary is a purpose rather than a person. Why do it that way?
CHARLES: I date this decision back to 2018 when Yvon changed the mission of the company to,We’re in business to save our home planet. And all of us who are involved in the company thought that’s incredibly inspiring, but what do we do? Like, how does it change what you do on Monday morning? And I think it did begin this really important shift. But, simultaneously, for the shareholders, that’s Yvon Chouinard and his family, they had to decide what did it mean as a shareholder? So, we looked at the idea of doing a direct listing but keeping control of the company with dual class shares. We looked at selling partial interest to a like-minded private equity firm, one of these permanent capital firms, as ways of releasing a lot of value to put against the environmental crisis right away. Yvon rejected each one of them, because each time, he said, This sounds good, but this is the beginning of the destruction of what Patagonia is. And so, that’s when we tried to come up with a structure that was essentially making the earth our shareholders.
LIZZIE: I want to push you on that a little bit though, because it seems like there is a fundamental challenge at the core of this. Which is, if the earth is your shareholder, right, if the focus is the climate crisis, you’re also making and selling stuff. Isn’t there some conflict there?
CHARLES: Yeah, of course there is. And that’s why we say we’re a responsible company that owns the conflict. It’s very hard to be in any kind of a business without having some damage done to the planet. What Yvon would say is, That’s why we need to focus on being responsible and we need to work with our customers, so that they only take what they need. They only purchase what they need. You’ll remember the famous ad we did in theNew York Times, which is, “Don’t buy this jacket.” We meant it.
LIZZIE: Well, let’s talk about that customer, right? Because you can do all of these things, and yet it’s possible that your customer is absorbing higher costs or slower delivery times, less stuff. I’d imagine if you are an executive listening to this, thinking,Yeah, that sounds great for Patagonia, but I don’t know how to do that with my company and my product. How do you thread that needle of being responsible and also meeting your customer’s needs?
CHARLES: I think first, the first thing I’d say is we can all do a lot better than we think we can. And the second thing, there’s a lot of easy excuses that people use, like Patagonia is a special case. But I think we need to challenge both public and private company leaders and owners to say, how can we do better? And so there is an inherent conflict in capitalism, and we can’t wish it away with a wand, but we can do better.
LIZZIE: What do you do with the growing pushback against ESG within businesses? And you’ll have business leaders saying, eh, we are not going to create as much value. We’re losing focus. How should business leaders deal with that?
CHARLES: Yeah. I think it’s easy for people to bundle a whole bunch of stuff in that actually isn’t essential. And sometimes that’s what gets an ideological reaction. And so sometimes there is actually benefit in stopping and saying, Huh, I wonder which part of this message we should really lean into in order to gain acceptance on what’s most important, not what’s perfect in the moment. And I think we just need to recognize that this is a forever journey, not a get-it-done journey. Yvon says we can’t do business on a dead planet. There really isn’t a trade-off at the end of the day, because we only get to do those things if we live in a way that ultimately is sustainable.
LIZZIE: Let’s talk about public companies, because if you’re listening to this and you work at a publicly traded company, a more conventional one, say, and you want to make that move toward being a more responsible company, but you have a fiduciary duty to your shareholders. You’re trying to figure out how to make all these things intersect. Is responsible business in the framework that you’ve laid out compatible with doing business in public markets?
CHARLES: Absolutely. This is a debate that we’ve been having and will continue to have no doubt for the next 50 years. But already institutional shareholders and the people who control the wealth behind them are demanding different behavior. And so, institutional capital is already saying to business, do good things, but also do it well. I think it’s terribly important that we take responsibility to the communities in which we operate. And that doesn’t just mean our employees. It means all the people who live in the communities in which businesses operate and to the resources that we use from the environment. So far-seeing leaders already recognize that we need to build that into the calculus.
LIZZIE: So, on a brass tacks level, if a C-suite executive is listening to this, and they want to do this, where do they start?
CHARLES: The most important thing you can do to start is to actually measure, because we can’t manage anything about our impacts until we know what our impacts are. And so I would say to executives at companies big and small,Get out in front of that by starting to do your own measures ahead of time. And then, what you’re going to find—and we certainly find this at Patagonia, which is—there are some things that are relatively low-hanging fruit, where you can make quite remarkable change in your business impact.
LIZZIE: Like what?
CHARLES: That’s often with energy use; that often has to do with sourcing relationships. You’ll find shortening supply chains, which are very deep at the moment, allows you better visibility into what’s going on. There are many things you can do in terms of changing your own behavior quite quickly and then working on the larger aspects of your supply chain, where you have people who are ready and willing to work with you. Ten years ago, if you went to a factory in Vietnam or a factory in Bangladesh, and you said, “I need you to change your energy usage to solar,” you wouldn’t have had a hearing. Today, they’re used to hearing that, because the biggest manufacturers are being required by their investors and by regulatory standards to take account of their impacts.
LIZZIE: Is there one thing that every business leader should do when they think about making their business more responsible?
CHARLES: We talked about an obvious thing, which is, you know, start by making sure you understand what your impacts are. But I think the next most important thing, and probably it’s more important, is that we set high aspirations for where we want to go. It doesn’t mean we need to achieve those tomorrow, but I think we’ll be more inspiring to our customers and much more inspiring to our employees and the other people we impact if we set high aspirations. Setting high aspirations that are aligned with company purpose is good for business, and it helps us remember that this is not just a trade-off between profit and doing good, that, ultimately, profit comes from doing good.
LIZZIE: But doesn’t that mean, and I think this is key, being OK with not being loved by everyone?
CHARLES: Yeah, it does. And I think that’s true.
LIZZIE: I think a lot of executives are nervous about that.
CHARLES: Well, you know, we’re not nervous about it at all. We are not afraid in Patagonia to offend some people. And when you stand for something, when you stand for purpose, there will be some people who stand against you. We don’t need that purpose to be one-size-fits-all.
LIZZIE: And in terms of what you expect as a return on your investments, how does thinking about responsibility change how you measure your projects and what you’re doing with your money?
CHARLES: We view the businesses that we start and the new lines of businesses that we start through the lens of how they help us achieve our purpose. And so it includes the financial sustainability, but also the impact that we have toward being in business to save our home planet. So recently, the last ten years, we entered the food business in a relatively small way. And we did it because Yvon said food is the biggest business in the world, and it has much more impact on both climate and species eradication. And so we’re going to be in food. And right from the very beginning, we’ve built into the goals for our food business how that creates regenerative, whether it’s fishing or regenerative agriculture, right at the very core of what we're doing. And that’s not something you measure in a hurdle rate. It’s something you measure in the complex ways that you assess a growing business.
LIZZIE: You cited thatNew York Timesad “Don’t buy this jacket.” Do you think less consumption has to be a part of the solution to a sustainable global economy?
CHARLES: Yeah, Lizzie, I do. I think we’re all going to have to come to terms with consuming less. And I think, you know, we’ve created a society over the course of the last 50 or so years where excess consumption has been part of all the messages delivered to us. And I think if you look back even 50 years, you’ll see that that, actually, that isn’t in our DNA. People in 1940 thought that houses of 1,300 or 1,400 square feet were perfectly adequate, and people of a few years before that thought that having two sets of clothing was adequate. Now, I don’t think we’re going back there, but I think we’ll build happier lives when we stop looking for our fulfillment in gift shops, to steal a line from Kurt Vonnegut, and actually start finding our meaning in things that don’t require the using up of the planet, but actually enjoying the planet.
LIZZIE: Lastly, what haven’t I asked you that is important for someone who is tentatively taking these steps, or thinking about how to reach their employees with real meaning around being a responsible company? What should they hear?
CHARLES: I think at the end of the day, we have to look to leadership of companies and other organizations to provide the aspirations and inspiration for these complex social organizations that are companies to actually move forward. And so, a lot is asked of our CEOs and senior management teams to bring this on board. And, you know, the benefit is our kids get to have the same kind of quality world that we grew up in, or hopefully better. All of us have benefited enormously from this technology, science, and industrial revolution that’s been going on for the last 100 or 150 years. All of our lives have become better in healthcare and in every other measurable way. And if we want to continue to have these incredibly advanced lives, we have to change how we’re doing it. And business is the most nimble of all the players. You know, where there’s governments, there’s supernational organizations like the UN. Business is the innovative and nimble engine here. It does call upon all of us who are business leaders to be in the vanguard, not to wait to be dragged along by our chain. It’s on us.
LIZZIE: Charles Conn, thank you so much.
CHARLES: Lizzie, it was a great pleasure to spend time together.
LIZZIE: Colm, what are you telling clients when it comes to being sustainable or responsible and whether there’s a difference?
COLM: Well, I think there is a difference, and I think Charles described it very well, actually. I think it’s very challenging and very debatable to suggest that an entire business throughout its value chain is, in inverted commas, sustainable. However, it’s entirely possible and indeed appropriate that a business can be responsible in all of its decision-making.
FEMI: Let’s talk about challenges and solutions. So what are the biggest barriers to companies making responsibility the most important part of their business? And then, how do they get over those barriers?
COLM: The most significant overarching barrier which most businesses face is the tension between delivering on the sustainability goals which they have set for themselves versus their financial performance over that period. And those periods to achieve those kinds of goals can actually be very long. And that tension is very real, and I think has to be very openly part of the conversation with shareholders—whether it’s a privately owned trust or whether it’s a publicly owned company. So I think that’s key. The first is to really engage with shareholders, to be very clear about what the objectives, the impacts, the sustainable impacts, the targets are, and what are the financial consequences of that journey to achieve those outcomes. I would also add something else in the context of those barriers. I think it’s really important for businesses which are embarking on this kind of journey to really ensure that they’re supportive of policy which delivers a level playing field. And that’s one of the real concerns about undertaking a significant, strategic transformation journey related to sustainability. Do we have a level playing field? And I think one of the things we would do is encourage businesses to ensure that policymakers are aware of the need for that level playing field and they appreciate the support of businesses to try and implement on that basis.
LIZZIE: Are there opportunities for businesses that are responsible and then put sustainability or responsibility at the top of their agenda? And I guess, what are those opportunities?
COLM: There absolutely are. And I would divide the opportunities into two categories. I think the first is a somewhat challenging one. But it’s a recognition of the reality that there are now really material risks in the system as a consequence of climate change and biodiversity challenges, and so on. So the first category of opportunity is for business to make sure that they know what those risks are. What are the financial risks to that business of the changes which we now know are going to roll through the system? They’re already baked in. And by definition, the businesses which have the best understanding of that are the ones which will be best placed to manage and perform better. I think the second category is a recognition that the scale of the change that we are now going to go through are very significant, and, by definition, they will create opportunities. They create opportunities for businesses to supply new products, new services, to engage with new kinds of customer, to operate in new markets in different ways, and so on.
LIZZIE: I think maybe one of the hardest things here, if you are a CEO, a C-suite executive, is bringing your investors and shareholders along with you on this journey. Patagonia, a purpose trust, a family run company, that’s different. So how, if you are talking to investors and shareholders, do you translate this mission to them?
COLM: Well, it is very different in practice, but interestingly, when you listen to Charles, he actually describes the same process of engagement. So they developed a strategy at the executive level. They brought variations on that strategy to their shareholder, to the family, to the trust. And ultimately, they landed on an agreement which the shareholders were comfortable with. That principle is exactly the same even for a public company. But as you say, it’s just a lot more difficult in practice. And so I think it’s useful to think about a number of quite specific steps as a business sets out to do that. I think the first is to really be clear on what it means. What exactly do we plan to do in the context of a sustainability strategy, and why? I think secondly, that same clarity needs to be brought to the conversation around the plan to deliver. How exactly is the business going to undertake its activities and priorities, and so on, to deliver on those target outcomes? Thirdly, and critically, what are the financial consequences of adopting that strategic agenda? And lastly, I would say, it’s really critical to acknowledge that there are tensions between those two aspects, particularly over prolonged periods of time. And it’s really important to have that conversation with investors to be clear about how those tensions are to be dealt with so that there are no surprises on the journey.
LIZZIE: Colm, how do investors fit into all of this? Because they have a role to play too.
COLM: Yeah, absolutely. And I think an increasingly pivotal role. The alternative option of business as usual actually isn’t business as usual, because the world around us is changing because of these issues, which means that the trade-offs that we’re making actually may not always be particularly, not just sustainable, but financially appealing.
FEMI: Colm, what does the future of sustainable and responsible business look like for you?
COLM: I think that we’re going to see the consequences of climate change, which is already baked in, unfolding year after year. We’ve seen it in the last few years. It will continue to deteriorate in the coming years. And I think, actually, some of the more severe consequences are going to happen sooner than many of us might’ve hoped. So we’ve got quite a challenging backdrop. And it’s not from 2050 onwards. It is from today onwards. This is real today and will unfold over the next five years and then beyond. And I think one consequence of that is that we will see perhaps an ever-reducing tolerance for businesses which are or are perceived to be part of the problem on the part of customers, on the part of employees, and indeed on the part of governments and regulators. So, I think we’re going to see actually a much more challenging environment, with much more pressure on businesses and economies to accelerate.
LIZZIE: Colm, thank you so much for coming on and spending this time with us today. I really appreciate it.
COLM: Thank you so much for having me.
FEMI: Lizzie, my takeaway from listening to Colm and Charles is how much clarity they had about what responsible business meant to both of them in the fields that they work in, saying, OK, this is what we do. This is how we do it. And they didn’t sugarcoat anything. It’s going to be hard, but they’re sticking with it.
LIZZIE: And I think the question you asked about the tension between being sustainable and making money was really key, because they both seem to come back to, it’s not an option, that this is happening, that there are significant financial risks for businesses that do not think about sustainability as a key part of their mission. And I found that incredibly edifying.
FEMI: And responsible business is also making money.
LIZZIE: Exactly.

TakeonTomorrow
Businesses today are under intense pressure to redefine what it means to be responsible. Leaders are tasked with managing environmental impacts, navigating climate change, and building rewarding experiences for employees and customers—all while maintaining financial performance. But how can they achieve these ambitious goals?
In this episode ofTake on Tomorrow, hosts Lizzie O’Leary and Femi Oke dive into this question with venture capital investor and Patagonia Board Chair, Charles Conn, who shares insights from Patagonia’s journey in aligning ethical commitments with commercial demands, offering valuable lessons for other companies. They also talk to Colm Kelly, Global Leader, Corporate Sustainability, for the PwC network, about how the real-world impacts of the climate transition are prompting change and reshaping boardroom priorities.
CHARLES CONN: We can’t do business on a dead planet. There really isn’t a trade-off at the end of the day.
COLM KELLY: The alternative option of business as usual actually isn’t business as usual, because the world around us is changing.
CHARLES: When you stand for something, there will be some people who stand against you. We don’t need that purpose to be one-size-fits-all.
FEMI OKE: From PwC’s management publicationstrategy and business, this isTake on Tomorrow, the podcast that brings together experts from around the globe to figure out what business could and shouldbe doing to tackle some of the biggest issues facing the world.
I’m Femi Oke, a broadcaster and journalist…
LIZZIE O’LEARY: …and I’m Lizzie O'Leary, a podcaster and journalist. Today, what does it take to run a responsible business—that also serves its shareholders?
LIZZIE: Business leaders are facing the ultimate balancing act. They want to be more sustainable. Make money. Keep their shareholders happy. Serve the customer. And the timeline to do all this is becoming shorter and shorter.
FEMI: It’s enough to make anyone’s head spin. So how should business leaders balance the need to make money and be sustainable?
LIZZIE: To find out, we’ll be talking to Charles Conn, the chairman of Patagonia, a company that calls themselves a responsible business.
FEMI: But first, to help us understand the pressures sustainable businesses are facing, we’re joined by Colm Kelly, Global Leader, Corporate Sustainability, for the PwC network. Hi there, Colm.
COLM: Hi there.
LIZZIE: Colm, to get us started, what are companies telling PwC about the way climate change is impacting their businesses right now?
COLM: Well, I think there’s probably three areas. The first is a growing recognition that climate is impacting on the business, on the value chain, on the supply chain. We see lots of issues over the last few years surfacing all over the planet, frankly, in terms of all kinds of weather events which impact on businesses negatively. The second, by definition, is entirely related, which is that businesses are increasingly conscious of the need to respond to that threat by decarbonizing. And I think the third area is where we see the expectation that businesses will be more transparent about reporting on their performance in relation to nonfinancial metrics in the sustainability space. So they’re the three areas that I think businesses are very conscious of.
FEMI: Colm, how are those conversations, those discussions, influencing the way that businesses think about their future?
COLM: Well, I think most businesses which have taken a look at the way in which the climate change challenge is unfolding are figuring out pretty quickly that we’re on a very challenging path, to say the least. And at a minimum, the changes which are already baked in, frankly, are going to, in some cases, have quite material implications for many businesses, never mind our communities and our societies. So you have this general context within which the conversation takes place, which quickly moves then to aso whatquestion. What should business do? What can business do? And how do we get that done?
FEMI: Colm, stay with us. We’ll come back to you soon. But first, Lizzie, you spoke to someone who has been leading the way when it comes to responsible business practices, right?
LIZZIE: Exactly. I was really excited to speak to Charles Conn, the Chair of Patagonia. And I began by asking him about how he got into running sustainable businesses.
CHARLES: My dad was someone who loved the outdoors, and so from as long as I can remember, we were in Maine and Nova Scotia, and I remember vividly looking at pond water under a microscope in third grade and just feeling like that protecting the world was important. But by the same token, I was also trained in, you know, what was called shareholder capitalism, which said externalities aren’t that important. Maximizing shareholder returns is what’s important. And then we’ll let shareholders decide what they give their money to. And I went to fancy business school, and I think what happened over time is you can’t help but notice the little changes that, actually, our own behavior does matter. And I think that gradual raising of consciousness made me a much more activist person around sustainability.
LIZZIE: Well, at Patagonia, you call yourselves a responsible company, not a sustainable company. Can you explain that distinction?
CHARLES: Yeah, we’re not yet a sustainable company. We’re on the journey to being a sustainable company. What we are is responsible, taking full responsibility for everything that goes into making a garment, not saying we run our own shop cleanly. We don’t know where the dyes come from, or where the fabrics come from, or the terrible conditions under which these clothes were actually put together. And that’s where the social and environmental consciousness of Patagonia comes from.
LIZZIE: You mentioned this journey, right? The company’s journey, and I think it’s fair to say that one of the biggest parts of that is the decision by founder Yvon Chouinard in 2022 to transfer ownership of Patagonia into what’s called a purpose trust, where the beneficiary is a purpose rather than a person. Why do it that way?
CHARLES: I date this decision back to 2018 when Yvon changed the mission of the company to,We’re in business to save our home planet. And all of us who are involved in the company thought that’s incredibly inspiring, but what do we do? Like, how does it change what you do on Monday morning? And I think it did begin this really important shift. But, simultaneously, for the shareholders, that’s Yvon Chouinard and his family, they had to decide what did it mean as a shareholder? So, we looked at the idea of doing a direct listing but keeping control of the company with dual class shares. We looked at selling partial interest to a like-minded private equity firm, one of these permanent capital firms, as ways of releasing a lot of value to put against the environmental crisis right away. Yvon rejected each one of them, because each time, he said, This sounds good, but this is the beginning of the destruction of what Patagonia is. And so, that’s when we tried to come up with a structure that was essentially making the earth our shareholders.
LIZZIE: I want to push you on that a little bit though, because it seems like there is a fundamental challenge at the core of this. Which is, if the earth is your shareholder, right, if the focus is the climate crisis, you’re also making and selling stuff. Isn’t there some conflict there?
CHARLES: Yeah, of course there is. And that’s why we say we’re a responsible company that owns the conflict. It’s very hard to be in any kind of a business without having some damage done to the planet. What Yvon would say is, That’s why we need to focus on being responsible and we need to work with our customers, so that they only take what they need. They only purchase what they need. You’ll remember the famous ad we did in theNew York Times, which is, “Don’t buy this jacket.” We meant it.
LIZZIE: Well, let’s talk about that customer, right? Because you can do all of these things, and yet it’s possible that your customer is absorbing higher costs or slower delivery times, less stuff. I’d imagine if you are an executive listening to this, thinking,Yeah, that sounds great for Patagonia, but I don’t know how to do that with my company and my product. How do you thread that needle of being responsible and also meeting your customer’s needs?
CHARLES: I think first, the first thing I’d say is we can all do a lot better than we think we can. And the second thing, there’s a lot of easy excuses that people use, like Patagonia is a special case. But I think we need to challenge both public and private company leaders and owners to say, how can we do better? And so there is an inherent conflict in capitalism, and we can’t wish it away with a wand, but we can do better.
LIZZIE: What do you do with the growing pushback against ESG within businesses? And you’ll have business leaders saying, eh, we are not going to create as much value. We’re losing focus. How should business leaders deal with that?
CHARLES: Yeah. I think it’s easy for people to bundle a whole bunch of stuff in that actually isn’t essential. And sometimes that’s what gets an ideological reaction. And so sometimes there is actually benefit in stopping and saying, Huh, I wonder which part of this message we should really lean into in order to gain acceptance on what’s most important, not what’s perfect in the moment. And I think we just need to recognize that this is a forever journey, not a get-it-done journey. Yvon says we can’t do business on a dead planet. There really isn’t a trade-off at the end of the day, because we only get to do those things if we live in a way that ultimately is sustainable.
LIZZIE: Let’s talk about public companies, because if you’re listening to this and you work at a publicly traded company, a more conventional one, say, and you want to make that move toward being a more responsible company, but you have a fiduciary duty to your shareholders. You’re trying to figure out how to make all these things intersect. Is responsible business in the framework that you’ve laid out compatible with doing business in public markets?
CHARLES: Absolutely. This is a debate that we’ve been having and will continue to have no doubt for the next 50 years. But already institutional shareholders and the people who control the wealth behind them are demanding different behavior. And so, institutional capital is already saying to business, do good things, but also do it well. I think it’s terribly important that we take responsibility to the communities in which we operate. And that doesn’t just mean our employees. It means all the people who live in the communities in which businesses operate and to the resources that we use from the environment. So far-seeing leaders already recognize that we need to build that into the calculus.
LIZZIE: So, on a brass tacks level, if a C-suite executive is listening to this, and they want to do this, where do they start?
CHARLES: The most important thing you can do to start is to actually measure, because we can’t manage anything about our impacts until we know what our impacts are. And so I would say to executives at companies big and small,Get out in front of that by starting to do your own measures ahead of time. And then, what you’re going to find—and we certainly find this at Patagonia, which is—there are some things that are relatively low-hanging fruit, where you can make quite remarkable change in your business impact.
LIZZIE: Like what?
CHARLES: That’s often with energy use; that often has to do with sourcing relationships. You’ll find shortening supply chains, which are very deep at the moment, allows you better visibility into what’s going on. There are many things you can do in terms of changing your own behavior quite quickly and then working on the larger aspects of your supply chain, where you have people who are ready and willing to work with you. Ten years ago, if you went to a factory in Vietnam or a factory in Bangladesh, and you said, “I need you to change your energy usage to solar,” you wouldn’t have had a hearing. Today, they’re used to hearing that, because the biggest manufacturers are being required by their investors and by regulatory standards to take account of their impacts.
LIZZIE: Is there one thing that every business leader should do when they think about making their business more responsible?
CHARLES: We talked about an obvious thing, which is, you know, start by making sure you understand what your impacts are. But I think the next most important thing, and probably it’s more important, is that we set high aspirations for where we want to go. It doesn’t mean we need to achieve those tomorrow, but I think we’ll be more inspiring to our customers and much more inspiring to our employees and the other people we impact if we set high aspirations. Setting high aspirations that are aligned with company purpose is good for business, and it helps us remember that this is not just a trade-off between profit and doing good, that, ultimately, profit comes from doing good.
LIZZIE: But doesn’t that mean, and I think this is key, being OK with not being loved by everyone?
CHARLES: Yeah, it does. And I think that’s true.
LIZZIE: I think a lot of executives are nervous about that.
CHARLES: Well, you know, we’re not nervous about it at all. We are not afraid in Patagonia to offend some people. And when you stand for something, when you stand for purpose, there will be some people who stand against you. We don’t need that purpose to be one-size-fits-all.
LIZZIE: And in terms of what you expect as a return on your investments, how does thinking about responsibility change how you measure your projects and what you’re doing with your money?
CHARLES: We view the businesses that we start and the new lines of businesses that we start through the lens of how they help us achieve our purpose. And so it includes the financial sustainability, but also the impact that we have toward being in business to save our home planet. So recently, the last ten years, we entered the food business in a relatively small way. And we did it because Yvon said food is the biggest business in the world, and it has much more impact on both climate and species eradication. And so we’re going to be in food. And right from the very beginning, we’ve built into the goals for our food business how that creates regenerative, whether it’s fishing or regenerative agriculture, right at the very core of what we're doing. And that’s not something you measure in a hurdle rate. It’s something you measure in the complex ways that you assess a growing business.
LIZZIE: You cited thatNew York Timesad “Don’t buy this jacket.” Do you think less consumption has to be a part of the solution to a sustainable global economy?
CHARLES: Yeah, Lizzie, I do. I think we’re all going to have to come to terms with consuming less. And I think, you know, we’ve created a society over the course of the last 50 or so years where excess consumption has been part of all the messages delivered to us. And I think if you look back even 50 years, you’ll see that that, actually, that isn’t in our DNA. People in 1940 thought that houses of 1,300 or 1,400 square feet were perfectly adequate, and people of a few years before that thought that having two sets of clothing was adequate. Now, I don’t think we’re going back there, but I think we’ll build happier lives when we stop looking for our fulfillment in gift shops, to steal a line from Kurt Vonnegut, and actually start finding our meaning in things that don’t require the using up of the planet, but actually enjoying the planet.
LIZZIE: Lastly, what haven’t I asked you that is important for someone who is tentatively taking these steps, or thinking about how to reach their employees with real meaning around being a responsible company? What should they hear?
CHARLES: I think at the end of the day, we have to look to leadership of companies and other organizations to provide the aspirations and inspiration for these complex social organizations that are companies to actually move forward. And so, a lot is asked of our CEOs and senior management teams to bring this on board. And, you know, the benefit is our kids get to have the same kind of quality world that we grew up in, or hopefully better. All of us have benefited enormously from this technology, science, and industrial revolution that’s been going on for the last 100 or 150 years. All of our lives have become better in healthcare and in every other measurable way. And if we want to continue to have these incredibly advanced lives, we have to change how we’re doing it. And business is the most nimble of all the players. You know, where there’s governments, there’s supernational organizations like the UN. Business is the innovative and nimble engine here. It does call upon all of us who are business leaders to be in the vanguard, not to wait to be dragged along by our chain. It’s on us.
LIZZIE: Charles Conn, thank you so much.
CHARLES: Lizzie, it was a great pleasure to spend time together.
LIZZIE: Colm, what are you telling clients when it comes to being sustainable or responsible and whether there’s a difference?
COLM: Well, I think there is a difference, and I think Charles described it very well, actually. I think it’s very challenging and very debatable to suggest that an entire business throughout its value chain is, in inverted commas, sustainable. However, it’s entirely possible and indeed appropriate that a business can be responsible in all of its decision-making.
FEMI: Let’s talk about challenges and solutions. So what are the biggest barriers to companies making responsibility the most important part of their business? And then, how do they get over those barriers?
COLM: The most significant overarching barrier which most businesses face is the tension between delivering on the sustainability goals which they have set for themselves versus their financial performance over that period. And those periods to achieve those kinds of goals can actually be very long. And that tension is very real, and I think has to be very openly part of the conversation with shareholders—whether it’s a privately owned trust or whether it’s a publicly owned company. So I think that’s key. The first is to really engage with shareholders, to be very clear about what the objectives, the impacts, the sustainable impacts, the targets are, and what are the financial consequences of that journey to achieve those outcomes. I would also add something else in the context of those barriers. I think it’s really important for businesses which are embarking on this kind of journey to really ensure that they’re supportive of policy which delivers a level playing field. And that’s one of the real concerns about undertaking a significant, strategic transformation journey related to sustainability. Do we have a level playing field? And I think one of the things we would do is encourage businesses to ensure that policymakers are aware of the need for that level playing field and they appreciate the support of businesses to try and implement on that basis.
LIZZIE: Are there opportunities for businesses that are responsible and then put sustainability or responsibility at the top of their agenda? And I guess, what are those opportunities?
COLM: There absolutely are. And I would divide the opportunities into two categories. I think the first is a somewhat challenging one. But it’s a recognition of the reality that there are now really material risks in the system as a consequence of climate change and biodiversity challenges, and so on. So the first category of opportunity is for business to make sure that they know what those risks are. What are the financial risks to that business of the changes which we now know are going to roll through the system? They’re already baked in. And by definition, the businesses which have the best understanding of that are the ones which will be best placed to manage and perform better. I think the second category is a recognition that the scale of the change that we are now going to go through are very significant, and, by definition, they will create opportunities. They create opportunities for businesses to supply new products, new services, to engage with new kinds of customer, to operate in new markets in different ways, and so on.
LIZZIE: I think maybe one of the hardest things here, if you are a CEO, a C-suite executive, is bringing your investors and shareholders along with you on this journey. Patagonia, a purpose trust, a family run company, that’s different. So how, if you are talking to investors and shareholders, do you translate this mission to them?
COLM: Well, it is very different in practice, but interestingly, when you listen to Charles, he actually describes the same process of engagement. So they developed a strategy at the executive level. They brought variations on that strategy to their shareholder, to the family, to the trust. And ultimately, they landed on an agreement which the shareholders were comfortable with. That principle is exactly the same even for a public company. But as you say, it’s just a lot more difficult in practice. And so I think it’s useful to think about a number of quite specific steps as a business sets out to do that. I think the first is to really be clear on what it means. What exactly do we plan to do in the context of a sustainability strategy, and why? I think secondly, that same clarity needs to be brought to the conversation around the plan to deliver. How exactly is the business going to undertake its activities and priorities, and so on, to deliver on those target outcomes? Thirdly, and critically, what are the financial consequences of adopting that strategic agenda? And lastly, I would say, it’s really critical to acknowledge that there are tensions between those two aspects, particularly over prolonged periods of time. And it’s really important to have that conversation with investors to be clear about how those tensions are to be dealt with so that there are no surprises on the journey.
LIZZIE: Colm, how do investors fit into all of this? Because they have a role to play too.
COLM: Yeah, absolutely. And I think an increasingly pivotal role. The alternative option of business as usual actually isn’t business as usual, because the world around us is changing because of these issues, which means that the trade-offs that we’re making actually may not always be particularly, not just sustainable, but financially appealing.
FEMI: Colm, what does the future of sustainable and responsible business look like for you?
COLM: I think that we’re going to see the consequences of climate change, which is already baked in, unfolding year after year. We’ve seen it in the last few years. It will continue to deteriorate in the coming years. And I think, actually, some of the more severe consequences are going to happen sooner than many of us might’ve hoped. So we’ve got quite a challenging backdrop. And it’s not from 2050 onwards. It is from today onwards. This is real today and will unfold over the next five years and then beyond. And I think one consequence of that is that we will see perhaps an ever-reducing tolerance for businesses which are or are perceived to be part of the problem on the part of customers, on the part of employees, and indeed on the part of governments and regulators. So, I think we’re going to see actually a much more challenging environment, with much more pressure on businesses and economies to accelerate.
LIZZIE: Colm, thank you so much for coming on and spending this time with us today. I really appreciate it.
COLM: Thank you so much for having me.
FEMI: Lizzie, my takeaway from listening to Colm and Charles is how much clarity they had about what responsible business meant to both of them in the fields that they work in, saying, OK, this is what we do. This is how we do it. And they didn’t sugarcoat anything. It’s going to be hard, but they’re sticking with it.
LIZZIE: And I think the question you asked about the tension between being sustainable and making money was really key, because they both seem to come back to, it’s not an option, that this is happening, that there are significant financial risks for businesses that do not think about sustainability as a key part of their mission. And I found that incredibly edifying.
FEMI: And responsible business is also making money.
LIZZIE: Exactly.

business value chain supply chain see lots issues over last few years surfacing all over planet frankly terms all kinds weather events which impact businesses negatively second definition entirely related which businesses increasingly conscious need respond threat decarbonizing think third area where see expectation businesses will more transparent about reporting their performance relation nonfinancial metrics sustainability space they three areas think businesses very conscious femi colm how those conversations those discussions influencing way businesses think about their future colm well think most businesses which have taken look way which climate change challenge unfolding figuring out pretty quickly very challenging path say least minimum changes which already baked frankly going some cases have quite material implications many businesses never mind our communities our societies you have general context within which conversation takes place which quickly moves then aso whatquestion what should business what can business how get done femi colm stay come back you soon but first lizzie you spoke someone who has been leading way when comes responsible business practices right lizzie exactly was really excited speak charles conn chair patagonia began asking him about how got into running sustainable businesses charles dad was someone who loved outdoors long can remember were maine nova scotia remember vividly looking pond water under microscope third grade just feeling like protecting world was important but same token was also trained you know what was called shareholder capitalism which said externalities aren important maximizing shareholder returns what important then let shareholders decide what they give their money went fancy business school think what happened over time you can help but notice little changes actually our own behavior does matter think gradual raising consciousness made much more activist person around sustainability lizzie well patagonia you call yourselves responsible company not sustainable company can you explain distinction charles yeah not yet sustainable company journey being sustainable company what responsible taking full responsibility everything goes into making garment not saying run our own shop cleanly don know where dyes come where fabrics come terrible conditions under which these clothes were actually put together where social environmental consciousness patagonia comes lizzie you mentioned journey right company journey think fair say one biggest parts decision founder yvon chouinard transfer ownership patagonia into what called purpose trust where beneficiary purpose rather than person why way charles date decision back when yvon changed mission company business save our home planet all who involved company thought incredibly inspiring but what like how does change what you monday morning think did begin really important shift but simultaneously shareholders yvon chouinard his family they had decide what did mean shareholder looked idea doing direct listing but keeping control company dual class shares looked selling partial interest like minded private equity firm one these permanent capital firms ways releasing lot value put against environmental crisis right away yvon rejected each one them because each time said sounds good but beginning destruction what patagonia when tried come structure was essentially making earth our shareholders lizzie want push you little bit though because seems like there fundamental challenge core which earth your shareholder right focus climate crisis you also making selling stuff isn there some conflict there charles yeah course there why say responsible company owns conflict very hard any kind business without having some damage done planet what yvon would say why need focus being responsible need work our customers they only take what they need they only purchase what they need you remember famous did thenew york times which don buy jacket meant lizzie well let talk about customer right because you can all these things yet possible your customer absorbing higher costs slower delivery times less stuff imagine you executive listening thinking yeah sounds great patagonia but don know how company product how you thread needle being responsible also meeting your customer needs charles think first first thing say can all lot better than think can second thing there lot easy excuses people use like patagonia special case but think need challenge both public private company leaders owners say how can better there inherent conflict capitalism can wish away wand but can better lizzie what you growing pushback against esg within businesses you have business leaders saying not going create much value losing focus how should business leaders deal charles yeah think easy people bundle whole bunch stuff actually isn essential sometimes what gets ideological reaction sometimes there actually benefit stopping saying huh wonder which part message should really lean into order gain acceptance what most important not what perfect moment think just need recognize forever journey not get done journey yvon says can business dead planet there really isn trade off end day because only get those things live way ultimately sustainable lizzie let talk about public companies because you listening you work publicly traded company more conventional one say you want make move toward being more responsible company but you have fiduciary duty your shareholders you trying figure out how make all these things intersect responsible business framework you laid out compatible doing business public markets charles absolutely debate been having will continue have doubt next years but already institutional shareholders people who control wealth behind them demanding different behavior institutional capital already saying business good things but also well think terribly important take responsibility communities which operate doesn just mean our employees means all people who live communities which businesses operate resources use environment far seeing leaders already recognize need build into calculus lizzie brass tacks level suite executive listening they want where they start charles most important thing you can start actually measure because can manage anything about our impacts until know what our impacts would say executives companies big small get out front starting your own measures ahead time then what you going find certainly find patagonia which there some things relatively low hanging fruit where you can make quite remarkable change your business impact lizzie like what charles often energy use often has sourcing relationships you find shortening supply chains which very deep moment allows you better visibility into what going there many things you can terms changing your own behavior quite quickly then working larger aspects your supply chain where you have people who ready willing work you ten years ago you went factory vietnam factory bangladesh you said need you change your energy usage solar you wouldn have had hearing today they used hearing because biggest manufacturers being required their investors regulatory standards take account their impacts lizzie there one thing every business leader should when they think about making their business more responsible charles talked about obvious thing which you know start making sure you understand what your impacts but think next most important thing probably more important set high aspirations where want doesn mean need achieve those tomorrow but think more inspiring our customers much more inspiring our employees other people impact set high aspirations setting high aspirations aligned company purpose good business helps remember not just trade off between profit doing good ultimately profit comes doing good lizzie but doesn mean think key being not being loved everyone charles yeah does think true lizzie think lot executives nervous about charles well you know not nervous about all not afraid patagonia offend some people when you stand something when you stand purpose there will some people who stand against you don need purpose one size fits all lizzie terms what you expect return your investments how does thinking about responsibility change how you measure your projects what you doing your money charles view businesses start new lines businesses start through lens how they help achieve our purpose includes financial sustainability but also impact have toward being business save our home planet recently last ten years entered food business relatively small way did because yvon said food biggest business world has much more impact both climate species eradication going food right very beginning built into goals our food business how creates regenerative whether fishing regenerative agriculture right very core what doing not something you measure hurdle rate something you measure complex ways you assess growing business lizzie you cited thatnew york timesad don buy jacket you think less consumption has part solution sustainable global economy charles yeah lizzie think all going have come terms consuming less think you know created society over course last years where excess consumption has been part all messages delivered think you look back even years you see actually isn our dna people thought houses square feet were perfectly adequate people few years before thought having two sets clothing was adequate now don think going back there but think build happier lives when stop looking our fulfillment gift shops steal line kurt vonnegut actually start finding our meaning things don require using planet but actually enjoying planet lizzie lastly what haven asked you important someone who tentatively taking these steps thinking about how reach their employees real meaning around being responsible company what should they hear charles think end day have look leadership companies other organizations provide aspirations inspiration these complex social organizations companies actually move forward lot asked our ceos senior management teams bring board you know benefit our kids get have same kind quality world grew hopefully better all have benefited enormously technology science industrial revolution been going last years all our lives have become better healthcare every other measurable way want continue have these incredibly advanced lives have change how doing business most nimble all players you know where there governments there supernational organizations like business innovative nimble engine here does call upon all who business leaders vanguard not wait dragged along our chain lizzie charles conn thank you much charles lizzie was great pleasure spend time together lizzie colm what you telling clients when comes being sustainable responsible whether there difference colm well think there difference think charles described very well actually think very challenging very debatable suggest entire business throughout its value chain inverted commas sustainable however entirely possible indeed appropriate business can responsible all its decision making femi let talk about challenges solutions what biggest barriers companies making responsibility most important part their business then how they get over those barriers colm most significant overarching barrier which most businesses face tension between delivering sustainability goals which they have set themselves versus their financial performance over period those periods achieve those kinds goals can actually very long tension very real think has very openly part conversation shareholders whether privately owned trust whether publicly owned company think key first really engage shareholders very clear about what objectives impacts sustainable impacts targets what financial consequences journey achieve those outcomes would also add something else context those barriers think really important businesses which embarking kind journey really ensure they supportive policy which delivers level playing field one real concerns about undertaking significant strategic transformation journey related sustainability have level playing field think one things would encourage businesses ensure policymakers aware need level playing field they appreciate support businesses try implement basis lizzie there opportunities businesses responsible then put sustainability responsibility top their agenda guess what those opportunities colm there absolutely would divide opportunities into two categories think first somewhat challenging one but recognition reality there now really material risks system consequence climate change biodiversity challenges first category opportunity business make sure they know what those risks what financial risks business changes which now know going roll through system they already baked definition businesses which have best understanding ones which will best placed manage perform better think second category recognition scale change now going through very significant definition they will create opportunities they create opportunities businesses supply new products new services engage new kinds customer operate new markets different ways lizzie think maybe one hardest things here you ceo suite executive bringing your investors shareholders along you journey patagonia purpose trust family run company different how you talking investors shareholders you translate mission them colm well very different practice but interestingly when you listen charles actually describes same process engagement they developed strategy executive level they brought variations strategy their shareholder family trust ultimately they landed agreement which shareholders were comfortable principle exactly same even public company but you say just lot more difficult practice think useful think about number quite specific steps business sets out think first really clear what means what exactly plan context sustainability strategy why think secondly same clarity needs brought conversation around plan deliver how exactly business going undertake its activities priorities deliver those target outcomes thirdly critically what financial consequences adopting strategic agenda lastly would say really critical acknowledge there tensions between those two aspects particularly over prolonged periods time really important have conversation investors clear about how those tensions dealt there surprises journey lizzie colm how investors fit into all because they have role play too colm yeah absolutely think increasingly pivotal role alternative option business usual actually isn business usual because world around changing because these issues which means trade offs making actually may not always particularly not just sustainable but financially appealing femi colm what does future sustainable responsible business look like you colm think going see consequences climate change which already baked unfolding year after year seen last few years will continue deteriorate coming years think actually some more severe consequences going happen sooner than many might hoped got quite challenging backdrop not onwards today onwards real today will unfold over next five years then beyond think one consequence will see perhaps ever reducing tolerance businesses which perceived part problem part customers part employees indeed part governments regulators think going see actually much more challenging environment much more pressure businesses economies accelerate lizzie colm thank you much coming spending time today really appreciate colm thank you much having femi lizzie takeaway listening colm charles how much clarity they had about what responsible business meant both them fields they work saying what how they didn sugarcoat anything going hard but they sticking lizzie think question you asked about tension between being sustainable making money was really key because they both seem come back not option happening there significant financial risks businesses not think about sustainability key part their mission found incredibly edifying femi responsible business also making money lizzie exactly femi

Our Global Centre for Crisis and Resilience co-leaders Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles and Dave Stainback discuss the importance of measuring and reporting on enterprise resilience maturity and how to go about it. They highlight the crucial role of technology and introduce PwC’s newly launchedEnterprise Resilience Assessment tool.
Release date: October 2024
Dave Stainback:Hi, everyone, and thanks so much for joining us today for this episode of Emerge Stronger Through Disruption. My name is Dave Stainback and I'm the co-leader ofPwC’s Global Centre for Crisis and Resilience, or GCCR for short. I'm coming to you from our office in Atlanta, Georgia. I'm also joined today by Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles, my GCCR co-leader. Great to be with you, as always, Bobbie.
Bobbie Ramsden-Knowles:Thanks, Dave, and really good to be here again today. Now, for those of you who are regular listeners, you'll know that the aim of this podcast is to explore the challenges facing businesses in this environment of constant crisis and change. And also to discuss how do successful business leaders emerge stronger through that disruption. So inour last episode, we focused on the increasing regulation landscape around resilience globally.
Dave what's going to be on our agenda today?
Dave:Today, I wanted us to discuss reporting and measuring enterprise resilience. There's been greater pressure for organisations to track and report on resilience maturity globally, and often I get asked by companies and those in industry about how to really go about that. Given that background, I thought it would be interesting to take a closer look at this and explore what it means for organisations and how one might go about tackling it.
Bobbie:Yeah, that sounds really interesting. I'm certainly seeing this from a lot of organisations as well. There's a lot of questions around resilience maturity and how do you measure it. So I think it's perfect timing for this topic.
Dave:Awesome. So let's dive right in. I think both of us can agree that we're seeing a lot of demand in this area. And that's really because of just the greater scrutiny for organisations, including, for example, obviously increasing regulations, which we talked about in our last episode. We discussed how regulators are placing that expectation on the industry to provide guarantees that they can continue to provide their critical services during a disruptive event.
That's exactly why it's important to show them how you're tracking your ability to actually do so, by conducting assessments and being able to demonstrate it via reporting and metrics, whether that's to regulators, customers or other stakeholders.
Bobbie:Yeah, exactly. And I think we also shared our view, didn't we, that it's important to get ahead of the regulation, because clearly there are some industries and sectors that they might not feel that time pressure just yet around resilience regulation, and perhaps there's a perception they don't need to necessarily worry about Operational Resilience (OpRes). But I think it is going to impact many organisations and many industries at some point.
So definitely worth getting ahead of it now.
Dave:Yeah, that's right, Bobbie. And not only is it going to become a more common requirement for organisations to track and measure those resilience capabilities, but it's also going to benefit them if they do so proactively. Like we've been talking about, we recommend organisations use the regulations not to just protect value, but to create value and ensure that longer term sustainability and success of their programme.
Bobbie:Right. So now the reason why it's important for companies to assess their maturity around resilience. Can you tell us, Dave, a bit about how we're going to go about measuring and reporting resilience?
Dave:Yeah, sure. So let's get into a bit of the nuts and bolts. First, I think we really have to reframe the approach. In the past, you and I and many of our colleagues would get requests from organisations to do very specific assessments of certain resilience capabilities. “Can you please come assess my business continuity programme?” or “Can you please come look at my crisis communications plan?”
Whereas today, we're really aiming to take a holistic snapshot of your overall resilience capabilities. That gives a better view into the strengths and areas of opportunity across different resilience domains, and also includes how well they're working together. We've been designing our Enterprise Resilience Assessment framework that really focuses on two major categories. The first being Strategic Resilience and the second being Operational Resilience.
Under that Strategic Resilience umbrella, we really cover a number of things like leadership, strategy, culture and behaviors, reputation management, financial management, workforce resilience, and enterprise risk management and those connections. Whereas, under the Operational Resilience Pillar, we include primarily six domains overall Operational Resilience and how you are adhering to OpRes. Crisis management, business continuity management, cyber resilience, physical security and emergency management, and technology resilience, which obviously is inclusive of disaster recovery.
And within each of those six Operational Resilience domains, we do a deeper dive looking at the following areas around their programme governance and policy, the programme design and maintenance of it, the technology enablement of those programmes, the assessment and analysis that is specific to each one of those Operational Resilience domains, their actual plans and plan development processes, real response and recovery experience, and then training and exercising.
And really the way that we try to go about these types of assessments is through interviews and facilitated discussions, we’ll gather information, asking a lot of different questions and collecting, reviewing documentation that exists. And then we really map it using a five-point scale capability maturity model integration or CMMI scoring system that aligns with international standards and leading practices.
And we put a lot of those into our overall thinking around this. And then we report on any company's maturity level for each of those areas, as well as holistically across all of those areas and map that up with what they believe their target state should be and some recommendations for how to get there. And that really allows us to then continue that conversation and help to build on that resilience journey, figure out what's next, what's working well in terms of the integration of capabilities and where they can improve to do so better going forward.
Bobbie:That all makes a lot of sense. I think is certainly going to help organisations, as you say, almost understand where they currently are, that baseline around this integrated Enterprise Resilience approach versus where do they want to be and then track the maturity as it improves over time and actually, I think it's going to be interesting because it will show the future, allow organisations to actually demonstrate the return on investment they've made when they do that.
Do you have any recent examples of where we've done this before and any insights from that?
Dave:Yeah, we have a number of these, but a good example is recently performed one of these holistic assessments, right? Broader assessments for a healthcare organisation. And like I mentioned before, this was a company that had historically performed individual assessments, ad hoc, on different resilience domains, whether that's business continuity or crisis management or disaster recovery. But following obviously a number of recent large-scale disruptions in the healthcare industry.
The Board pressed them and wanted to have a comprehensive view across all of the programmes and disciplines. So, it really allowed management and the Board to see which areas were strong and which ones might need shorter- and longer-term investment to improve them in order to meet the target maturity expectations across the board of the Resilience programme as opposed to within just individual silos.
One of the things that we've done as a result of that, and certainly the high demand for this, as well as the work that our global team has been putting into developing our framework, is we've taken that framework, and we've built out what we call PwC’sEnterprise Resilience Assessmentor ERA tool. And it's an interactive web-based platform with algorithmic analysis, and it gives us the ability to take all of that framework and go through question sets and questionnaires with organisations and then be able to provide maturity scoring and recommendations and road mapping all in one seamless, integrated platform.
So it's an exciting development that we've been able to leverage and hope to use many more times going forward.
Bobbie:Yeah, that's great, Dave. I think for me what's been really interesting and exciting actually in working this is just the amount of knowledge we've pulled together across the network, across the global centre, to inform the development of the assessment tool, but also that it really does nicely align with the PwC Enterprise Resilience Framework, which we've talked about on many other episodes as well.
I mean, I'm personally very excited about the launch of the tool. So we've covered the why and the how, which are both clearly really important. And with all our episodes, we'd like to give our listeners actionable takeaways. So, do you have any tips on what they might want to take away and start doing today or is there a specific call to action you'd like them to hear Dave?
Dave:Well, I think a call to action in terms of assessing overall resilience maturity is really the change of approach and not doing it on an individual resilience domain or silo by silo approach. And sort of shifting to looking at it across the entire integrated programme. I think that would be the big recommendation that I would give coming out of this and  hope organisations will think about as they go forward.
And then separately, while assessing maturity is certainly a critical step to identify where you are on a curve, the other type of measurement for a resilience programme is the metrics. Metrics, data reporting on the programme day to day, week to week, year over year. And it's really how you track activity, action, response and recovery times, incident types and trends and many more things.
And I think that we see a lot of organisations that are focused on trying to develop this, but it's not necessarily easy. Right? And so there's a few factors that we are seeing, as many different companies are working to establish resilience metrics and we're trying to assist them. The first is that data and technology are paramount. There's an important role for technology and software both in maintaining and integrating the resilience data, but also being able to use it to drive better informed risk decision making.
But there's a number of inherent difficulties in this process from selecting the right indicators and metrics to the complexities of the data and where you're pulling it from, how you collect it, and then frankly, how you interpret it. A lot of the traditional ways of collecting and maintaining data within resilience disciplines has been manual and inefficient and software and strong programme governance are required to do this really well today.
So tactically, the solution is beginning to invest and embrace the power of technology. One of the things from ourGlobal Crisis and Resilience Surveyfrom last year was that almost 60% of the business leaders that responded understand the need to underpin their resilience strategy with technology that allows them to actually mine actionable intelligence from the data across the business.
And so, if properly configured and built into a well-governed programme, that type of technology, that type of software can provide that single pane of glass, panoramic view of your resilience programme and a lot of your risks. And it allows you to transform your resilience programme from being kind of static and manual to dynamic, scalable, integrated and frankly, proactive.
It certainly takes effort and it takes investment, but by overcoming those challenges, you can really build a robust framework for resilience and that gives you the measurable metrics that can then serve as the backbone for any successful resilience initiatives and future risk decisioning, enabling organisations to withstand and adapt to unexpected challenges and disruptions as they occur.
Bobbie:Brilliant. And I think that's a really, really good place to wrap it up. It's been a great discussion, as always, and I hope for our listeners they found it a useful one. I think we should definitely continue the topic of the critical role that technology plays in building resilience and hope to do so in one of our next podcasts.
So, I definitely recommend to our listeners to stay tuned because we've got some exciting speakers lined up for that one.
Dave:Sounds great. Thank you, Bobbie, and thank you all so much. In upcoming episodes, Emerge Stronger Through Disruption, we'll continue to tackle these topics that keep business leaders up at night, and we'd love to hear ideas from listeners about topics you'd like us to address. So please get in touch with both Bobbie and me via LinkedIn. We would love to hear from you.
And in the meantime, remember to subscribe to Emerge Stronger Through Disruption wherever you get your podcasts. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next time.

much joining today episode emerge stronger through disruption name dave stainback leader ofpwc global centre crisis resilience gccr short coming you our office atlanta georgia also joined today bobbie ramsden knowles gccr leader great you always bobbie bobbie ramsden knowles thanks dave really good here again today now those you who regular listeners you know aim podcast explore challenges facing businesses environment constant crisis change also discuss how successful business leaders emerge stronger through disruption inour last episode focused increasing regulation landscape around resilience globally dave what going our agenda today dave today wanted discuss reporting measuring enterprise resilience there been greater pressure organisations track report resilience maturity globally often get asked companies those industry about how really about given background thought would interesting take closer look explore what means organisations how one might about tackling bobbie yeah sounds really interesting certainly seeing lot organisations well there lot questions around resilience maturity how you measure think perfect timing topic dave awesome let dive right think both can agree seeing lot demand area really because just greater scrutiny organisations including example obviously increasing regulations which talked about our last episode discussed how regulators placing expectation industry provide guarantees they can continue provide their critical services during disruptive event exactly why important show them how you tracking your ability actually conducting assessments being able demonstrate via reporting metrics whether regulators customers other stakeholders bobbie yeah exactly think also shared our view didn important get ahead regulation because clearly there some industries sectors they might not feel time pressure just yet around resilience regulation perhaps there perception they don need necessarily worry about operational resilience opres but think going impact many organisations many industries some point definitely worth getting ahead now dave yeah right bobbie not only going become more common requirement organisations track measure those resilience capabilities but also going benefit them they proactively like been talking about recommend organisations use regulations not just protect value but create value ensure longer term sustainability success their programme bobbie right now reason why important companies assess their maturity around resilience can you tell dave bit about how going about measuring reporting resilience dave yeah sure let get into bit nuts bolts first think really have reframe approach past you many our colleagues would get requests organisations very specific assessments certain resilience capabilities can you please come assess business continuity programme can you please come look crisis communications plan whereas today really aiming take holistic snapshot your overall resilience capabilities gives better view into strengths areas opportunity across different resilience domains also includes how well they working together been designing our enterprise resilience assessment framework really focuses two major categories first being strategic resilience second being operational resilience under strategic resilience umbrella really cover number things like leadership strategy culture behaviors reputation management financial management workforce resilience enterprise risk management those connections whereas under operational resilience pillar include primarily six domains overall operational resilience how you adhering opres crisis management business continuity management cyber resilience physical security emergency management technology resilience which obviously inclusive disaster recovery within each those six operational resilience domains deeper dive looking following areas around their programme governance policy programme design maintenance technology enablement those programmes assessment analysis specific each one those operational resilience domains their actual plans plan development processes real response recovery experience then training exercising really way try about these types assessments through interviews facilitated discussions gather information asking lot different questions collecting reviewing documentation exists then really map using five point scale capability maturity model integration cmmi scoring system aligns international standards leading practices put lot those into our overall thinking around then report any company maturity level each those areas well holistically across all those areas map what they believe their target state should some recommendations how get there really allows then continue conversation help build resilience journey figure out what next what working well terms integration capabilities where they can improve better going forward bobbie all makes lot sense think certainly going help organisations you say almost understand where they currently baseline around integrated enterprise resilience approach versus where they want then track maturity improves over time actually think going interesting because will show future allow organisations actually demonstrate return investment they made when they you have any recent examples where done before any insights dave yeah have number these but good example recently performed one these holistic assessments right broader assessments healthcare organisation like mentioned before was company had historically performed individual assessments hoc different resilience domains whether business continuity crisis management disaster recovery but following obviously number recent large scale disruptions healthcare industry board pressed them wanted have comprehensive view across all programmes disciplines really allowed management board see which areas were strong which ones might need shorter longer term investment improve them order meet target maturity expectations across board resilience programme opposed within just individual silos one things done result certainly high demand well work our global team has been putting into developing our framework taken framework built out what call pwc senterprise resilience assessmentor era tool interactive web based platform algorithmic analysis gives ability take all framework through question sets questionnaires organisations then able provide maturity scoring recommendations road mapping all one seamless integrated platform exciting development been able leverage hope use many more times going forward bobbie yeah great dave think what been really interesting exciting actually working just amount knowledge pulled together across network across global centre inform development assessment tool but also really does nicely align pwc enterprise resilience framework which talked about many other episodes well mean personally very excited about launch tool covered why how which both clearly really important all our episodes like give our listeners actionable takeaways you have any tips what they might want take away start doing today there specific call action you like them hear dave dave well think call action terms assessing overall resilience maturity really change approach not doing individual resilience domain silo silo approach sort shifting looking across entire integrated programme think would big recommendation would give coming out hope organisations will think about they forward then separately while assessing maturity certainly critical step identify where you curve other type measurement resilience programme metrics metrics data reporting programme day day week week year over year really how you track activity action response recovery times incident types trends many more things think see lot organisations focused trying develop but not necessarily easy right there few factors seeing many different companies working establish resilience metrics trying assist them first data technology paramount there important role technology software both maintaining integrating resilience data but also being able use drive better informed risk decision making but there number inherent difficulties process selecting right indicators metrics complexities data where you pulling how you collect then frankly how you interpret lot traditional ways collecting maintaining data within resilience disciplines has been manual inefficient software strong programme governance required really well today tactically solution beginning invest embrace power technology one things ourglobal crisis resilience surveyfrom last year was almost business leaders responded understand need underpin their resilience strategy technology allows them actually mine actionable intelligence data across business properly configured built into well governed programme type technology type software can provide single pane glass panoramic view your resilience programme lot your risks allows you transform your resilience programme being kind static manual dynamic scalable integrated frankly proactive certainly takes effort takes investment but overcoming those challenges you can really build robust framework resilience gives you measurable metrics can then serve backbone any successful resilience initiatives future risk decisioning enabling organisations withstand adapt unexpected challenges disruptions they occur bobbie brilliant think really really good place wrap been great discussion always hope our listeners they found useful one think should definitely continue topic critical role technology plays building resilience hope one our next podcasts definitely recommend our listeners stay tuned because got some exciting speakers lined one dave sounds great thank you bobbie thank you all much upcoming episodes emerge stronger through

Global food security is facing increased threats. Climate change, global tensions, global population growth and supply chain disruptions mean our food systems are becoming more precarious. So, what role can businesses play in reimagining our food systems? And how can they help with the changes that will be required to secure our food supply for generations to come?In this episode, hosts Lizzie O’Leary and Femi Oke are joined by Rob Cameron, Global Head of ESG Engagement at Nestlé, and Stuti Sethi from Strategy&, PwC’s global strategy consulting business to explore how companies can help reimagine food systems and work with governments to ensure a secure, reliable supply—and why a combined effort is vital for the future of food.
ROB CAMERON: The very steps you want to take to mitigate your impacts are the same steps that are going to increase your resilience in the face of increased drought, heat, floods, et cetera. You have a more resilient farm when you’ve got a more natural farm.STUTI SETHI: If we could do it from scratch, how would we set it up so that the whole system can benefit from the way that we produce our food and do it in a way that works with nature?ROB: This is not like opening a new factory, where on Day One, boom, the lights are on, you’re making things, away you go, you’ve got production lines humming. No, in the case of agriculture and the natural world, you’re very often doing things today that’ll actually deliver a payback in future.
LIZZIE O’LEARY: From PwC’s management publication strategy and business, this is Take on Tomorrow, the podcast that brings together experts from around the globe to figure out what business could and should be doing to tackle some of the biggest issues facing the world.
I’m Lizzie O’Leary, a podcaster and journalist…
FEMI OKE: …and I’m Femi Oke, a broadcaster and journalist. Today, how do we secure the future of food?
LIZZIE: If you open your kitchen cupboard right now—and to be honest, any podcast, especially Take on Tomorrow, is always better with a little snack—you’ll find food from all over the world: coffee from Brazil, chocolate from Indonesia, fruit from Nigeria, vegetables from Spain.
FEMI: I just smiled when you said fruit from Nigeria. I’m thinking of a great big juicy plantain right now. It’s pretty amazing when you think about it. And it’s all possible thanks to a combination of farms, producers, big companies, and transport that make up our food system.
LIZZIE: But this delicate balancing act is under threat. Adverse weather, biodiversity loss, global tensions, and supply chain disruptions all mean that the way we get our food is vulnerable.
FEMI: Exactly, Lizzie. And that raises a question for me. How can we protect our food for decades to come? To find the answer, we will be talking to Rob Cameron, Global Head of ESG Engagement at Nestlé.
LIZZIE: But first, we’re joined by Stuti Sethi, a thought leader with Strategy&, who spends a lot of time thinking about the future of food—and what it means for the world. Welcome to the show.
STUTI: Thanks. Thanks for having me.
FEMI: Stuti, can you help us understand where are we right now. How does our food system currently work?
STUTI: Sure. Well, look, I think you said it in the introduction, right? We have producers, and that’s farmers and growers. They’re all over the world. Something like 600 million of them. On the other hand, we have our consumers, and we’re all consumers of food. So we’re talking about 8 billion people. And in the middle, we have a range of companies, and they could be doing something as simple as taking wheat and milling it and turning it into flour. Or it could be much more complicated, bringing ingredients from across the world to make the frozen pizza that you find on your shelf. And in that system, you have small players. You also have four very big aggregators, or traders, as we call them, who help move these global commodities from the farmers and the growers to some of the processing facilities. And then you have, of course, the CPG [consumer packaged goods] companies. There’s roughly ten really big ones across the world and a lot of smaller ones there. And then you have retailers. And retailers are typically a really local-for-local business. But at the same time, there are a few big companies involved in that space as well.
LIZZIE: Stuti, we’re going to come back to you to hear more about the role of businesses, consumers, and policymakers in securing our food systems a little bit later. But first, Femi, I know you have been digging into this issue with one of the biggest companies in food production.
FEMI: Absolutely. We wanted to understand how businesses are preparing for some of these challenges. So I spoke to Rob Cameron. Global Head of ESG Engagement at Nestlé. And I began by asking him to explain the challenges facing Nestlé in particular.
ROB: Everything in our food systems begins with agriculture. We are entirely dependent upon agriculture for our company’s success and for delivering the foods and beverages that people enjoy around the world. And agriculture, of course, is dependent on nature. And yet, we also know the natural world is under terrific stress. When you look at edible plants, you know, there’s something like 7,000 edible plants in the world. Only about 150 or so of them are actually cultivated. And something like 60% of the world’s calories come from three plants. I mean, if that isn’t a vulnerability, I don’t know what is. So there are these spots of vulnerability in the food systems that I think, you know, really are big risks.FEMI: Can you give us an example of how you’re adapting or how it is changing the way you do business and produce products?ROB: Let’s just track it back to, sort of, 2004, 5, 6, with this concept of creating shared value. And this was the realization on the part of the management at the time that a company that already had a near 100-year history at that moment, you know, if it was going to be around for another 100 years, needed to think more broadly—thinking about how it creates value and thinking about how to create value for society by thinking about the environment and thinking about communities, as well as thinking about shareholders. Then we take it forward to, I would say, 2019, when the then-CEO Mark Schneider signed up for the UN Global Compact and the UN agreement on, Can we get to net zero by 2050? So, we became a signatory of that. And that was a big shift for the business. And so, what it meant was we had to publish a net-zero road map, which we did. And when you look at that road map, what you’ll see is that there is a very strong emphasis on agricultural footprint—what we’re buying and where we’re buying it from. So we’ve got to think about how we work with farmers, how we work with suppliers, in order to drive cuts in our emissions base, because that’s the only real place we’re going to make an impact.
FEMI: What are you seeing right now that you think in five or ten years is going to pay dividends because you’ve already anticipated a new way to be sustainable?
ROB: This is an area which I think is a real issue for many, many businesses. If you’re thinking about, OK, so we’re drawing carbon out of the atmosphere in forests. Well, that doesn’t start when you plant a tree. In fact, what you’re doing is you’re making an investment into the future. Now, this is not like opening a new factory where on Day One, boom, the lights are on, you’re making things, away you go, you’ve got production lines humming. No, in the case of agriculture and the natural world, you’re very often doing things today that’ll actually deliver a payback in future. We spend a ton of money on regenerative agriculture or on forests. It’s actually quite hard to capitalize them. I sometimes think it would make life a lot easier if we could.FEMI: You just dropped that phrase regenerative agriculture into your conversation. Almost anybody who uses that phrase has a completely different description. What’s yours?ROB: We are on the cusp of the biggest transition in agriculture since the invention of the Haber-Bosch process in the early 1900s. That’s the process by which we were able to create synthetic fertilizers. That’s what led to the massive uplift in productivity in agriculture, but with huge negative consequences as well in terms of fossil fuel impacts. So that’s what we now call conventional agriculture. I would argue regenerative agriculture is actually a series of practices that are designed to deliver the crops that you need, and at the same time improve the environment in which they are growing. So, we have something like 16 separate practices that we would say are steps towards regenerative agriculture. One of those might be, for instance, leaving a margin around the field for wildlife, you know, biodiversity to flourish in a strip of land around the field. Terrific idea. Does that make the field in the middle regenerative? No, it doesn’t. It’s a regenerative practice that, combined with other practices, may get to a point where that farm could be considered truly regenerative. But I think we have to be a bit thoughtful about that. But the practices themselves, they’re often common sense. I mean, they’re things that I grew up learning about when I was at school many, many years ago. Crop rotation, for example, reducing the amount of synthetic fertilizers, using organic fertilizers, planting trees, you know, and so on and so forth. There are a whole series of practices that we’ve mapped out, and we’re working with farmers to help them to put these practices into play on their farms.FEMI: You’ve mapped out these practices already, but how long will it take for farmers that you work with to take them up?ROB: When we launched the net-zero road map, we made very clear that we were prepared to put some money behind this. So 3.2 billion Swiss francs total in the period 2020 to 2025 on the whole of the road map, of which 1.2 billion was earmarked for kickstarting regenerative practices. Now, a lot of people would assume that Nestlé is a remote company that buys on the global commodity markets and has no direct relationships with farmers. It is true that we buy a lot of commodities on global commodities markets, but it’s also true that we have direct trading relationships with something in the region of 600,000 farmers. Many of them are coffee farmers, many cocoa farmers, particularly dairy farmers. So that gives us a great opportunity to work with farmers, to encourage them. And how do we do that? Well, technical assistance. We have something like 2,000 agronomists that will get out there on the farm and work with farmers to help them to put these practices into operation. We pay premiums when a product is produced using these regenerative practices. There’s finance available, insurance, and loan schemes, and so on. So, there’s a whole range of interventions. But one thing is clear: at the center of it all, you have to put the farmer. Because if you just turn up at the farm gate and tell the farmer, This is what we want you to do, or you’re not going to get to do business with us, that’s not what farmers want to hear.It’s a big step. It’s a big step. I mean, Femi, if I said to you, what I want you to do is to change the way that you’re working. I’m going to cut your salary by 30%, but I guarantee you, by changing the way you’re working, your income will improve in two years’ time or three years’ time. You know, that’s a bit of a big bet you’re being asked to make. I’m not sure many of us that are salaried, we’d want to take that on. But in a sense, that’s what we’re asking farmers to do.FEMI: I’m just thinking about the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Two years ago, 2022, they reported that the global food system accounts for 42% of global greenhouse gas emissions. What does Nestlé do about that?ROB: It’s absolutely incumbent upon the whole of the agricultural system to start looking at, OK, how are we going to reduce our impacts? We’re not going to get to net zero without significant cuts in agricultural emissions. We have to stop using fossil fuel fertilizers, or at least radically reduce the use of fossil fuel fertilizers. We need to think about emissions from dairy. That’s a huge issue. We’ve got to think about how we fix more carbon in soils, how we plant more trees, integrate more trees into our farm system, so that we’re using farming to draw CO2 down out of the atmosphere and fix it in the ground. All of the steps that we’re proposing, do you know what the real magic sauce of this is? It actually increases farmer resilience. The very steps you want to take to mitigate your impacts are the same steps that are going to increase your resilience in the face of increased drought, heat, floods, and hurricanes and storms, et cetera. You have a more resilient farm when you’ve got a more natural farm. And so for us, whilst I think there is an urgent responsibility on us, actually, there’s also a very, very, very strong case to our investors that this is what we need to do to ensure a resilient supply chain in the future.FEMI: Well, I feel that you’re quite bullish about the state of our food systems right now. They’re robust, they’re resilient. From your perspective, what will they look like in about ten years’ time? What is that transformation process?ROB: So firstly to say, I don’t want you to come away from this that I’m somehow bullish about food systems. I do think that food systems will see this through. But I do think there’s a huge amount of work ahead of us to make our food systems, that they’re making a positive impact on the environment and delivering safe, nutritious, and delicious food for consumers. So there’s a lot to do. No question, right? Now, some forecasters have been particularly positive about, for example, precision fermentation, and that this is going to completely disrupt food systems. Technology, advanced technologies will definitely come to bear on the food systems that we have. These technologies, which are struggling at the moment to scale from lab to pilot and then pilot to mainstream, will find their way through, eventually. It’ll take a little bit longer, I think, than some are saying. But that’s one of the changes. I think advanced technologies will be a significant impact on food systems in the future.
FEMI: If you’re a business that’s not involved in food and are looking at the example of Nestlé and similar companies, what are the lessons that can be learned?
ROB: I think one of the things I would point to is—and it goes back to this thing of creating shared value, and—I think, people-centricity. Having just said, yeah, technology is going to make an impact, and it will. But I don’t think we get anywhere with technology. We don’t get anywhere with regenerative agriculture. We don’t get anywhere with cutting CO2 emissions, et cetera, et cetera, unless we’re people-centric. What about consumers? What about farmers? What about employees? What about people in our value chain? Thinking about how people are going to make the difference. Because at the end of the day, that’s what it is. It’s people that make the difference. So I think that kind of communities-first thinking, I think, is incredibly important.FEMI: Rob Cameron, thanks for joining us.
ROB: Thanks for having me. Great to chat. Thanks, Femi.
LIZZIE: Stuti, Rob talked about the role of regenerative agriculture, but I want to zoom out a little bit. What kinds of conversations are you having right now with clients around food systems? Risks? Opportunities? What is on their radar right now?
STUTI: I actually think clients are looking at this from multiple different perspectives now. There is this sort of immediate question that comes up because there’s a lot of regulation coming their way, particularly in Europe. So, it’s, a lot of it is around the reporting and how do they manage some of that. But what I also see, particularly thinking about things like regenerative agriculture, is that companies have really big sustainability goals. And when it comes to food systems players, typically, the biggest source of emissions is the food system and their crops and their farms. The other side of that is really understanding the risk to the supply chain. This is about climate modeling and getting to know which crops are actually going to be at risk in the future. Also, this year, we’ve seen the volatility in coffee prices. You’ve seen olive oil getting really expensive, and these things have really made companies go, Hey, I need to do something and think about this. Another key thing is that because something like coffee has really been, the way that I see it, the canary in the coalmine, companies start to see, Hey, this is the kind of crop that takes eight years to fruit. So if I need to look at my own value chain, where are the biggest risks? Another crop that sort of makes you think in that way is hops. Hops only grow within a certain longitude and latitude. So if you want beer in the future, you need to make sure that it’s going to be climate resilient. So that’s a really big area. Another thing that I see is a lot of companies are looking at, can they provide a value-added service in helping farmers move towards more sustainable, regenerative agricultural practices?
FEMI: If we are focusing on the future of food and how to make our food systems more robust, what are technological solutions that you are seeing that are impressing you? I’m thinking AI, obviously. What else is there?
STUTI: When it comes to the food system, we have a lot of solutions already. And I’m going to start first with mechanization. So, 45% of Indian agriculture is mechanized today. And if you compare that to Western Europe, we’re talking about 70%. So, there’s still a big role for simpler solutions like tractors. And on the other hand, if I think more about the things that you’re thinking of, so, real new technologies like AI, we’re talking about, you know, at the farm level, it’s the use of data about soil, about crops, about weather, and maybe potentially helping farmers make better decisions in that space. It’s some of the buzzwords that you might hear, like vertical farming, precision agriculture, even little robots that can plant seeds into the ground. But the big issue here is that a lot of these technologies are not yet at scale, and there’s a lot of funding required to get them to the right cost level. I think, maybe, the most interesting one for me right now, which is really tangible, is probably the use of AI in really reducing food waste. Thirty percent of the food that we produce never gets consumed. So, if we can use technology to do things like dynamic pricing at the retailers so that people buy it before it goes to waste, or you can look at how you can maintain the right conditions in transport, those kinds of things, I think, get me maybe the most excited, because you see it really tangibly and quickly.
FEMI: One of the jobs that you do is planning strategy. If you were to talk to policymakers and business leaders about building a better food system, what would you tell them?
STUTI: I think what needs to happen is a lot more figuring out these solutions together and finding new ways of funding the changes we need. When it comes to farming, for example, a lot of it is subsidized, right? And there’s a lot of agricultural policy that exists around the globe because farmers are a really important part of each country’s landscape. I think there is a big role for government there. You know, they can make those decisions around what to incentivize, what to subsidize, what to penalize. And you see that there is already some experimentation with this, right? There are sugar taxes in Brazil. Denmark is going to try out a carbon tax on dairy and on beef in 2030. And I wonder how some of these things are going to play out. I see that there’s a really strong piece there that governments can control. And it’s that mix, right? It’s that real balance of how do you make sure that farmers can actually have a good and successful livelihood? And at the same time, how do we start this shift to a better food system? The big problem with a lot of these things is, Hey, if I’m the first mover, I’m taking on a cost and I might not see the results of that investment for quite some time or somebody else takes the benefit. So creating that level playing field and making it easier to also take these sustainable steps is a big part of it as well.
LIZZIE: Building on that a bit, when you’re talking about being the first mover, steps that don’t pay off immediately, some of the practices that Rob talked about have a longer time horizon, and I wonder how a business leader can take those steps and bring their shareholders, a very key constituency, along with them when maybe there isn’t an immediate payoff to show quickly.
STUTI: In the end, you need to have the vision and you need to create that vision for your shareholders on why you need to do this and what are some of the big issues that you’re going to face. When it comes to the food system, I think there is now pretty clear evidence that we need to make these changes. And you can use resilience as a key point on this. And maybe, the first step is even just starting with the educational aspect, right? On making sure that you understand what your climate risk exposure is and what the exposure is upstream so that your shareholders start to understand that risk as well. And you can show, Hey, these are the actions we need to take. The timeframe and the payoff, honestly, it’s going to really depend on each individual company. So how they make those decisions is really tied up with where they see those opportunities. But I do want to say here, I mean, think about the energy transition and the way that it panned out in electric vehicles, right? We knew about this technology for a very long time. The existing companies didn’t take action. It took a new player like Tesla to come in, and they have made a mint off of it, right? So those opportunities are there, and we need to see who figures it out.
FEMI: As we think about securing the future of food, it’s a conversation that we’re all involved in. Nobody opts out because it’s not our business. Because we all have to eat and we all use the food systems. But if you’re a non-food business, how should you be thinking about the future of our food systems? What’s relevant?
STUTI: I think there’s a lot, actually. So we’ve really spoken, I guess, more about the core food companies, right? But supporting this entire system, you have banks, you have insurance companies, you’ve got manufacturing companies that are providing those tractors we spoke about somewhere earlier. Yeah. So there are actually a lot of different players around this whole space. On the consumer side, there’s also healthcare, of course, because what you eat has an effect on what your health looks like. There’s the infrastructure aspect of this, because when it comes to food systems, Hey, if your food gets stuck in a port, you’ve got a lot of waste happening. So I think there are a lot of different roles to play here. And the more that companies can actually find those new ways of working together, I think, the more likely we are to get this transition and this change to really take place.
LIZZIE: Stuti, when you are thinking about the future of food and food systems, what are you most excited by?
STUTI: I think it’s the idea of us rethinking this system and redesigning what’s now quite complicated, actually. So I think at some point, I started looking into the journey of a typical tomato, and you realize that these things are going back and forth across the globe to get to where they are. So if we could do it from scratch, how would we set it up so that the whole system can benefit from the way that we produce our food and do it in a way that works with nature? That’s what gets me excited.
LIZZIE: Stuti, thank you so much for talking with us today.
STUTI: Thanks for the conversation. It was a lot of fun.
FEMI: I got such a clear idea of futurism from listening to Rob and chatting to Stuti, because I think we often think about technology, our future in technology, and they were thinking about something so basic that we all have to do, which is eat and our food systems, but projecting how we need to be thinking about them. And there was that moment where Stuti mentioned, if we don’t make hops climate resilient, where’s the beer going to come from?
LIZZIE: Where’s the beer? I wasn’t just the only person that perked up at that. I was like, Oh!
FEMI: Maybe that’s how we should be talking about the future of our food systems, because that will really hit home about how important our food systems are.
LIZZIE: I think there were two specific things that stuck with me. This was an episode with a lot of really intriguing specifics: Rob talking about how few edible plants we actually cultivate and eat was really fascinating to me.
FEMI: Shocking!
LIZZIE: Truly shocking. And then the idea that Stuti put forward that you could use AI to do something like reduce food waste by injecting dynamic pricing, right? At the end of the day, come get your tomatoes, corn, what have you, and it’s cheap because we don’t want it to go to waste. That’s brilliant. That’s so simple.

Global food security is facing increased threats. Climate change, global tensions, global population growth and supply chain disruptions mean our food systems are becoming more precarious. So, what role can businesses play in reimagining our food systems? And how can they help with the changes that will be required to secure our food supply for generations to come?In this episode, hosts Lizzie O’Leary and Femi Oke are joined by Rob Cameron, Global Head of ESG Engagement at Nestlé, and Stuti Sethi from Strategy&, PwC’s global strategy consulting business to explore how companies can help reimagine food systems and work with governments to ensure a secure, reliable supply—and why a combined effort is vital for the future of food.
ROB CAMERON: The very steps you want to take to mitigate your impacts are the same steps that are going to increase your resilience in the face of increased drought, heat, floods, et cetera. You have a more resilient farm when you’ve got a more natural farm.STUTI SETHI: If we could do it from scratch, how would we set it up so that the whole system can benefit from the way that we produce our food and do it in a way that works with nature?ROB: This is not like opening a new factory, where on Day One, boom, the lights are on, you’re making things, away you go, you’ve got production lines humming. No, in the case of agriculture and the natural world, you’re very often doing things today that’ll actually deliver a payback in future.
LIZZIE O’LEARY: From PwC’s management publication strategy and business, this is Take on Tomorrow, the podcast that brings together experts from around the globe to figure out what business could and should be doing to tackle some of the biggest issues facing the world.
I’m Lizzie O’Leary, a podcaster and journalist…
FEMI OKE: …and I’m Femi Oke, a broadcaster and journalist. Today, how do we secure the future of food?
LIZZIE: If you open your kitchen cupboard right now—and to be honest, any podcast, especially Take on Tomorrow, is always better with a little snack—you’ll find food from all over the world: coffee from Brazil, chocolate from Indonesia, fruit from Nigeria, vegetables from Spain.
FEMI: I just smiled when you said fruit from Nigeria. I’m thinking of a great big juicy plantain right now. It’s pretty amazing when you think about it. And it’s all possible thanks to a combination of farms, producers, big companies, and transport that make up our food system.
LIZZIE: But this delicate balancing act is under threat. Adverse weather, biodiversity loss, global tensions, and supply chain disruptions all mean that the way we get our food is vulnerable.
FEMI: Exactly, Lizzie. And that raises a question for me. How can we protect our food for decades to come? To find the answer, we will be talking to Rob Cameron, Global Head of ESG Engagement at Nestlé.
LIZZIE: But first, we’re joined by Stuti Sethi, a thought leader with Strategy&, who spends a lot of time thinking about the future of food—and what it means for the world. Welcome to the show.
STUTI: Thanks. Thanks for having me.
FEMI: Stuti, can you help us understand where are we right now. How does our food system currently work?
STUTI: Sure. Well, look, I think you said it in the introduction, right? We have producers, and that’s farmers and growers. They’re all over the world. Something like 600 million of them. On the other hand, we have our consumers, and we’re all consumers of food. So we’re talking about 8 billion people. And in the middle, we have a range of companies, and they could be doing something as simple as taking wheat and milling it and turning it into flour. Or it could be much more complicated, bringing ingredients from across the world to make the frozen pizza that you find on your shelf. And in that system, you have small players. You also have four very big aggregators, or traders, as we call them, who help move these global commodities from the farmers and the growers to some of the processing facilities. And then you have, of course, the CPG [consumer packaged goods] companies. There’s roughly ten really big ones across the world and a lot of smaller ones there. And then you have retailers. And retailers are typically a really local-for-local business. But at the same time, there are a few big companies involved in that space as well.
LIZZIE: Stuti, we’re going to come back to you to hear more about the role of businesses, consumers, and policymakers in securing our food systems a little bit later. But first, Femi, I know you have been digging into this issue with one of the biggest companies in food production.
FEMI: Absolutely. We wanted to understand how businesses are preparing for some of these challenges. So I spoke to Rob Cameron. Global Head of ESG Engagement at Nestlé. And I began by asking him to explain the challenges facing Nestlé in particular.
ROB: Everything in our food systems begins with agriculture. We are entirely dependent upon agriculture for our company’s success and for delivering the foods and beverages that people enjoy around the world. And agriculture, of course, is dependent on nature. And yet, we also know the natural world is under terrific stress. When you look at edible plants, you know, there’s something like 7,000 edible plants in the world. Only about 150 or so of them are actually cultivated. And something like 60% of the world’s calories come from three plants. I mean, if that isn’t a vulnerability, I don’t know what is. So there are these spots of vulnerability in the food systems that I think, you know, really are big risks.FEMI: Can you give us an example of how you’re adapting or how it is changing the way you do business and produce products?ROB: Let’s just track it back to, sort of, 2004, 5, 6, with this concept of creating shared value. And this was the realization on the part of the management at the time that a company that already had a near 100-year history at that moment, you know, if it was going to be around for another 100 years, needed to think more broadly—thinking about how it creates value and thinking about how to create value for society by thinking about the environment and thinking about communities, as well as thinking about shareholders. Then we take it forward to, I would say, 2019, when the then-CEO Mark Schneider signed up for the UN Global Compact and the UN agreement on, Can we get to net zero by 2050? So, we became a signatory of that. And that was a big shift for the business. And so, what it meant was we had to publish a net-zero road map, which we did. And when you look at that road map, what you’ll see is that there is a very strong emphasis on agricultural footprint—what we’re buying and where we’re buying it from. So we’ve got to think about how we work with farmers, how we work with suppliers, in order to drive cuts in our emissions base, because that’s the only real place we’re going to make an impact.
FEMI: What are you seeing right now that you think in five or ten years is going to pay dividends because you’ve already anticipated a new way to be sustainable?
ROB: This is an area which I think is a real issue for many, many businesses. If you’re thinking about, OK, so we’re drawing carbon out of the atmosphere in forests. Well, that doesn’t start when you plant a tree. In fact, what you’re doing is you’re making an investment into the future. Now, this is not like opening a new factory where on Day One, boom, the lights are on, you’re making things, away you go, you’ve got production lines humming. No, in the case of agriculture and the natural world, you’re very often doing things today that’ll actually deliver a payback in future. We spend a ton of money on regenerative agriculture or on forests. It’s actually quite hard to capitalize them. I sometimes think it would make life a lot easier if we could.FEMI: You just dropped that phrase regenerative agriculture into your conversation. Almost anybody who uses that phrase has a completely different description. What’s yours?ROB: We are on the cusp of the biggest transition in agriculture since the invention of the Haber-Bosch process in the early 1900s. That’s the process by which we were able to create synthetic fertilizers. That’s what led to the massive uplift in productivity in agriculture, but with huge negative consequences as well in terms of fossil fuel impacts. So that’s what we now call conventional agriculture. I would argue regenerative agriculture is actually a series of practices that are designed to deliver the crops that you need, and at the same time improve the environment in which they are growing. So, we have something like 16 separate practices that we would say are steps towards regenerative agriculture. One of those might be, for instance, leaving a margin around the field for wildlife, you know, biodiversity to flourish in a strip of land around the field. Terrific idea. Does that make the field in the middle regenerative? No, it doesn’t. It’s a regenerative practice that, combined with other practices, may get to a point where that farm could be considered truly regenerative. But I think we have to be a bit thoughtful about that. But the practices themselves, they’re often common sense. I mean, they’re things that I grew up learning about when I was at school many, many years ago. Crop rotation, for example, reducing the amount of synthetic fertilizers, using organic fertilizers, planting trees, you know, and so on and so forth. There are a whole series of practices that we’ve mapped out, and we’re working with farmers to help them to put these practices into play on their farms.FEMI: You’ve mapped out these practices already, but how long will it take for farmers that you work with to take them up?ROB: When we launched the net-zero road map, we made very clear that we were prepared to put some money behind this. So 3.2 billion Swiss francs total in the period 2020 to 2025 on the whole of the road map, of which 1.2 billion was earmarked for kickstarting regenerative practices. Now, a lot of people would assume that Nestlé is a remote company that buys on the global commodity markets and has no direct relationships with farmers. It is true that we buy a lot of commodities on global commodities markets, but it’s also true that we have direct trading relationships with something in the region of 600,000 farmers. Many of them are coffee farmers, many cocoa farmers, particularly dairy farmers. So that gives us a great opportunity to work with farmers, to encourage them. And how do we do that? Well, technical assistance. We have something like 2,000 agronomists that will get out there on the farm and work with farmers to help them to put these practices into operation. We pay premiums when a product is produced using these regenerative practices. There’s finance available, insurance, and loan schemes, and so on. So, there’s a whole range of interventions. But one thing is clear: at the center of it all, you have to put the farmer. Because if you just turn up at the farm gate and tell the farmer, This is what we want you to do, or you’re not going to get to do business with us, that’s not what farmers want to hear.It’s a big step. It’s a big step. I mean, Femi, if I said to you, what I want you to do is to change the way that you’re working. I’m going to cut your salary by 30%, but I guarantee you, by changing the way you’re working, your income will improve in two years’ time or three years’ time. You know, that’s a bit of a big bet you’re being asked to make. I’m not sure many of us that are salaried, we’d want to take that on. But in a sense, that’s what we’re asking farmers to do.FEMI: I’m just thinking about the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Two years ago, 2022, they reported that the global food system accounts for 42% of global greenhouse gas emissions. What does Nestlé do about that?ROB: It’s absolutely incumbent upon the whole of the agricultural system to start looking at, OK, how are we going to reduce our impacts? We’re not going to get to net zero without significant cuts in agricultural emissions. We have to stop using fossil fuel fertilizers, or at least radically reduce the use of fossil fuel fertilizers. We need to think about emissions from dairy. That’s a huge issue. We’ve got to think about how we fix more carbon in soils, how we plant more trees, integrate more trees into our farm system, so that we’re using farming to draw CO2 down out of the atmosphere and fix it in the ground. All of the steps that we’re proposing, do you know what the real magic sauce of this is? It actually increases farmer resilience. The very steps you want to take to mitigate your impacts are the same steps that are going to increase your resilience in the face of increased drought, heat, floods, and hurricanes and storms, et cetera. You have a more resilient farm when you’ve got a more natural farm. And so for us, whilst I think there is an urgent responsibility on us, actually, there’s also a very, very, very strong case to our investors that this is what we need to do to ensure a resilient supply chain in the future.FEMI: Well, I feel that you’re quite bullish about the state of our food systems right now. They’re robust, they’re resilient. From your perspective, what will they look like in about ten years’ time? What is that transformation process?ROB: So firstly to say, I don’t want you to come away from this that I’m somehow bullish about food systems. I do think that food systems will see this through. But I do think there’s a huge amount of work ahead of us to make our food systems, that they’re making a positive impact on the environment and delivering safe, nutritious, and delicious food for consumers. So there’s a lot to do. No question, right? Now, some forecasters have been particularly positive about, for example, precision fermentation, and that this is going to completely disrupt food systems. Technology, advanced technologies will definitely come to bear on the food systems that we have. These technologies, which are struggling at the moment to scale from lab to pilot and then pilot to mainstream, will find their way through, eventually. It’ll take a little bit longer, I think, than some are saying. But that’s one of the changes. I think advanced technologies will be a significant impact on food systems in the future.
FEMI: If you’re a business that’s not involved in food and are looking at the example of Nestlé and similar companies, what are the lessons that can be learned?
ROB: I think one of the things I would point to is—and it goes back to this thing of creating shared value, and—I think, people-centricity. Having just said, yeah, technology is going to make an impact, and it will. But I don’t think we get anywhere with technology. We don’t get anywhere with regenerative agriculture. We don’t get anywhere with cutting CO2 emissions, et cetera, et cetera, unless we’re people-centric. What about consumers? What about farmers? What about employees? What about people in our value chain? Thinking about how people are going to make the difference. Because at the end of the day, that’s what it is. It’s people that make the difference. So I think that kind of communities-first thinking, I think, is incredibly important.FEMI: Rob Cameron, thanks for joining us.
ROB: Thanks for having me. Great to chat. Thanks, Femi.
LIZZIE: Stuti, Rob talked about the role of regenerative agriculture, but I want to zoom out a little bit. What kinds of conversations are you having right now with clients around food systems? Risks? Opportunities? What is on their radar right now?
STUTI: I actually think clients are looking at this from multiple different perspectives now. There is this sort of immediate question that comes up because there’s a lot of regulation coming their way, particularly in Europe. So, it’s, a lot of it is around the reporting and how do they manage some of that. But what I also see, particularly thinking about things like regenerative agriculture, is that companies have really big sustainability goals. And when it comes to food systems players, typically, the biggest source of emissions is the food system and their crops and their farms. The other side of that is really understanding the risk to the supply chain. This is about climate modeling and getting to know which crops are actually going to be at risk in the future. Also, this year, we’ve seen the volatility in coffee prices. You’ve seen olive oil getting really expensive, and these things have really made companies go, Hey, I need to do something and think about this. Another key thing is that because something like coffee has really been, the way that I see it, the canary in the coalmine, companies start to see, Hey, this is the kind of crop that takes eight years to fruit. So if I need to look at my own value chain, where are the biggest risks? Another crop that sort of makes you think in that way is hops. Hops only grow within a certain longitude and latitude. So if you want beer in the future, you need to make sure that it’s going to be climate resilient. So that’s a really big area. Another thing that I see is a lot of companies are looking at, can they provide a value-added service in helping farmers move towards more sustainable, regenerative agricultural practices?
FEMI: If we are focusing on the future of food and how to make our food systems more robust, what are technological solutions that you are seeing that are impressing you? I’m thinking AI, obviously. What else is there?
STUTI: When it comes to the food system, we have a lot of solutions already. And I’m going to start first with mechanization. So, 45% of Indian agriculture is mechanized today. And if you compare that to Western Europe, we’re talking about 70%. So, there’s still a big role for simpler solutions like tractors. And on the other hand, if I think more about the things that you’re thinking of, so, real new technologies like AI, we’re talking about, you know, at the farm level, it’s the use of data about soil, about crops, about weather, and maybe potentially helping farmers make better decisions in that space. It’s some of the buzzwords that you might hear, like vertical farming, precision agriculture, even little robots that can plant seeds into the ground. But the big issue here is that a lot of these technologies are not yet at scale, and there’s a lot of funding required to get them to the right cost level. I think, maybe, the most interesting one for me right now, which is really tangible, is probably the use of AI in really reducing food waste. Thirty percent of the food that we produce never gets consumed. So, if we can use technology to do things like dynamic pricing at the retailers so that people buy it before it goes to waste, or you can look at how you can maintain the right conditions in transport, those kinds of things, I think, get me maybe the most excited, because you see it really tangibly and quickly.
FEMI: One of the jobs that you do is planning strategy. If you were to talk to policymakers and business leaders about building a better food system, what would you tell them?
STUTI: I think what needs to happen is a lot more figuring out these solutions together and finding new ways of funding the changes we need. When it comes to farming, for example, a lot of it is subsidized, right? And there’s a lot of agricultural policy that exists around the globe because farmers are a really important part of each country’s landscape. I think there is a big role for government there. You know, they can make those decisions around what to incentivize, what to subsidize, what to penalize. And you see that there is already some experimentation with this, right? There are sugar taxes in Brazil. Denmark is going to try out a carbon tax on dairy and on beef in 2030. And I wonder how some of these things are going to play out. I see that there’s a really strong piece there that governments can control. And it’s that mix, right? It’s that real balance of how do you make sure that farmers can actually have a good and successful livelihood? And at the same time, how do we start this shift to a better food system? The big problem with a lot of these things is, Hey, if I’m the first mover, I’m taking on a cost and I might not see the results of that investment for quite some time or somebody else takes the benefit. So creating that level playing field and making it easier to also take these sustainable steps is a big part of it as well.
LIZZIE: Building on that a bit, when you’re talking about being the first mover, steps that don’t pay off immediately, some of the practices that Rob talked about have a longer time horizon, and I wonder how a business leader can take those steps and bring their shareholders, a very key constituency, along with them when maybe there isn’t an immediate payoff to show quickly.
STUTI: In the end, you need to have the vision and you need to create that vision for your shareholders on why you need to do this and what are some of the big issues that you’re going to face. When it comes to the food system, I think there is now pretty clear evidence that we need to make these changes. And you can use resilience as a key point on this. And maybe, the first step is even just starting with the educational aspect, right? On making sure that you understand what your climate risk exposure is and what the exposure is upstream so that your shareholders start to understand that risk as well. And you can show, Hey, these are the actions we need to take. The timeframe and the payoff, honestly, it’s going to really depend on each individual company. So how they make those decisions is really tied up with where they see those opportunities. But I do want to say here, I mean, think about the energy transition and the way that it panned out in electric vehicles, right? We knew about this technology for a very long time. The existing companies didn’t take action. It took a new player like Tesla to come in, and they have made a mint off of it, right? So those opportunities are there, and we need to see who figures it out.
FEMI: As we think about securing the future of food, it’s a conversation that we’re all involved in. Nobody opts out because it’s not our business. Because we all have to eat and we all use the food systems. But if you’re a non-food business, how should you be thinking about the future of our food systems? What’s relevant?
STUTI: I think there’s a lot, actually. So we’ve really spoken, I guess, more about the core food companies, right? But supporting this entire system, you have banks, you have insurance companies, you’ve got manufacturing companies that are providing those tractors we spoke about somewhere earlier. Yeah. So there are actually a lot of different players around this whole space. On the consumer side, there’s also healthcare, of course, because what you eat has an effect on what your health looks like. There’s the infrastructure aspect of this, because when it comes to food systems, Hey, if your food gets stuck in a port, you’ve got a lot of waste happening. So I think there are a lot of different roles to play here. And the more that companies can actually find those new ways of working together, I think, the more likely we are to get this transition and this change to really take place.
LIZZIE: Stuti, when you are thinking about the future of food and food systems, what are you most excited by?
STUTI: I think it’s the idea of us rethinking this system and redesigning what’s now quite complicated, actually. So I think at some point, I started looking into the journey of a typical tomato, and you realize that these things are going back and forth across the globe to get to where they are. So if we could do it from scratch, how would we set it up so that the whole system can benefit from the way that we produce our food and do it in a way that works with nature? That’s what gets me excited.
LIZZIE: Stuti, thank you so much for talking with us today.
STUTI: Thanks for the conversation. It was a lot of fun.
FEMI: I got such a clear idea of futurism from listening to Rob and chatting to Stuti, because I think we often think about technology, our future in technology, and they were thinking about something so basic that we all have to do, which is eat and our food systems, but projecting how we need to be thinking about them. And there was that moment where Stuti mentioned, if we don’t make hops climate resilient, where’s the beer going to come from?
LIZZIE: Where’s the beer? I wasn’t just the only person that perked up at that. I was like, Oh!
FEMI: Maybe that’s how we should be talking about the future of our food systems, because that will really hit home about how important our food systems are.
LIZZIE: I think there were two specific things that stuck with me. This was an episode with a lot of really intriguing specifics: Rob talking about how few edible plants we actually cultivate and eat was really fascinating to me.
FEMI: Shocking!
LIZZIE: Truly shocking. And then the idea that Stuti put forward that you could use AI to do something like reduce food waste by injecting dynamic pricing, right? At the end of the day, come get your tomatoes, corn, what have you, and it’s cheap because we don’t want it to go to waste. That’s brilliant. That’s so simple.

around globe figure out what business could should doing tackle some biggest issues facing world lizzie leary podcaster journalist femi oke femi oke broadcaster journalist today how secure future food lizzie you open your kitchen cupboard right now honest any podcast especially take tomorrow always better little snack you find food all over world coffee brazil chocolate indonesia fruit nigeria vegetables spain femi just smiled when you said fruit nigeria thinking great big juicy plantain right now pretty amazing when you think about all possible thanks combination farms producers big companies transport make our food system lizzie but delicate balancing act under threat adverse weather biodiversity loss global tensions supply chain disruptions all mean way get our food vulnerable femi exactly lizzie raises question how can protect our food decades come find answer will talking rob cameron global head esg engagement nestl lizzie but first joined stuti sethi thought leader strategy who spends lot time thinking about future food what means world welcome show stuti thanks thanks having femi stuti can you help understand where right now how does our food system currently work stuti sure well look think you said introduction right have producers farmers growers they all over world something like million them other hand have our consumers all consumers food talking about billion people middle have range companies they could doing something simple taking wheat milling turning into flour could much more complicated bringing ingredients across world make frozen pizza you find your shelf system you have small players you also have four very big aggregators traders call them who help move these global commodities farmers growers some processing facilities then you have course cpg consumer packaged goods companies there roughly ten really big ones across world lot smaller ones there then you have retailers retailers typically really local local business but same time there few big companies involved space well lizzie stuti going come back you hear more about role businesses consumers policymakers securing our food systems little bit later but first femi know you have been digging into issue one biggest companies food production femi absolutely wanted understand how businesses preparing some these challenges spoke rob cameron global head esg engagement nestl began asking him explain challenges facing nestl particular rob everything our food systems begins agriculture entirely dependent upon agriculture our company success delivering foods beverages people enjoy around world agriculture course dependent nature yet also know natural world under terrific stress when you look edible plants you know there something like edible plants world only about them actually cultivated something like world calories come three plants mean isn vulnerability don know what there these spots vulnerability food systems think you know really big risks femi can you give example how you adapting how changing way you business produce products rob let just track back sort concept creating shared value was realization part management time company already had near year history moment you know was going around another years needed think more broadly thinking about how creates value thinking about how create value society thinking about environment thinking about communities well thinking about shareholders then take forward would say when then ceo mark schneider signed global compact agreement can get net zero became signatory was big shift business what meant was had publish net zero road map which did when you look road map what you see there very strong emphasis agricultural footprint what buying where buying got think about how work farmers how work suppliers order drive cuts our emissions base because only real place going make impact femi what you seeing right now you think five ten years going pay dividends because you already anticipated new way sustainable rob area which think real issue many many businesses you thinking about drawing carbon out atmosphere forests well doesn start when you plant tree fact what you doing you making investment into future now not like opening new factory where day one boom lights you making things away you you got production lines humming case agriculture natural world you very often doing things today actually deliver payback future spend ton money regenerative agriculture forests actually quite hard capitalize them sometimes think would make life lot easier could femi you just dropped phrase regenerative agriculture into your conversation almost anybody who uses phrase has completely different description what yours rob cusp biggest transition agriculture since invention haber bosch process early process which were able create synthetic fertilizers what led massive uplift productivity agriculture but huge negative consequences well terms fossil fuel impacts what now call conventional agriculture would argue regenerative agriculture actually series practices designed deliver crops you need same time improve environment which they growing have something like separate practices would say steps towards regenerative agriculture one those might instance leaving margin around field wildlife you know biodiversity flourish strip land around field terrific idea does make field middle regenerative doesn regenerative practice combined other practices may get point where farm could considered truly regenerative but think have bit thoughtful about but practices themselves they often common sense mean they things grew learning about when was school many many years ago crop rotation example reducing amount synthetic fertilizers using organic fertilizers planting trees you know forth there whole series practices mapped out working farmers help them put these practices into play their farms femi you mapped out these practices already but how long will take farmers you work take them rob when launched net zero road map made very clear were prepared put some money behind billion swiss francs total period whole road map which billion was earmarked kickstarting regenerative practices now lot people would assume nestl remote company buys global commodity markets has direct relationships farmers true buy lot commodities global commodities markets but also true have direct trading relationships something region farmers many them coffee farmers many cocoa farmers particularly dairy farmers gives great opportunity work farmers encourage them how well technical assistance have something like agronomists will get out there farm work farmers help them put these practices into operation pay premiums when product produced using these regenerative practices there finance available insurance loan schemes there whole range interventions but one thing clear center all you have put farmer because you just turn farm gate tell farmer what want you you not going get business not what farmers want hear big step big step mean femi said you what want you change way you working going cut your salary but guarantee you changing way you working your income will improve two years time three years time you know bit big bet you being asked make not sure many salaried want take but sense what asking farmers femi just thinking about ipcc intergovernmental panel climate change two years ago they reported global food system accounts global greenhouse gas emissions what does nestl about rob absolutely incumbent upon whole agricultural system start looking how going reduce our impacts not going get net zero without significant cuts agricultural emissions have stop using fossil fuel fertilizers least radically reduce use fossil fuel fertilizers need think about emissions dairy huge issue got think about how fix more carbon soils how plant more trees integrate more trees into our farm system using farming draw down out atmosphere fix ground all steps proposing you know what real magic sauce actually increases farmer resilience very steps you want take mitigate your impacts same steps going increase your resilience face increased drought heat floods hurricanes storms cetera you have more resilient farm when you got more natural farm whilst think there urgent responsibility actually there also very very very strong case our investors what need ensure resilient supply chain future femi well feel you quite bullish about state our food systems right now they robust they resilient your perspective what will they look like about ten years time what transformation process rob firstly say don want you come away somehow bullish about food systems think food systems will see through but think there huge amount work ahead make our food systems they making positive impact environment delivering safe nutritious delicious food consumers there lot question right now some forecasters have been particularly positive about example precision fermentation going completely disrupt food systems technology advanced technologies will definitely come bear food systems have these technologies which struggling moment scale lab pilot then pilot mainstream will find their way through eventually take little bit longer think than some saying but one changes think advanced technologies will significant impact food systems future femi you business not involved food looking example nestl similar companies what lessons can learned rob think one things would point goes back thing creating shared value think people centricity having just said yeah technology going make impact will but don think get anywhere technology don get anywhere regenerative agriculture don get anywhere cutting emissions cetera cetera unless people centric what about consumers what about farmers what about employees what about people our value chain thinking about how people going make difference because end day what people make difference think kind communities first thinking think incredibly important femi rob cameron thanks joining rob thanks having great chat thanks femi lizzie stuti rob talked about role regenerative agriculture but want zoom out little bit what kinds conversations you having right now clients around food systems risks opportunities what their radar right now stuti actually think clients looking multiple different perspectives now there sort immediate question comes because there lot regulation coming their way particularly europe lot around reporting how they manage some but what also see particularly thinking about things like regenerative agriculture companies have really big sustainability goals when comes food systems players typically biggest source emissions food system their crops their farms other side really understanding risk supply chain about climate modeling getting know which crops actually going risk future also year seen volatility coffee prices you seen olive oil getting really expensive these things have really made companies hey need something think about another key thing because something like coffee has really been way see canary coalmine companies start see hey kind crop takes eight years fruit need look own value chain where biggest risks another crop sort makes you think way hops hops only grow within certain longitude latitude you want beer future you need make sure going climate resilient really big area another thing see lot companies looking can they provide value added service helping farmers move towards more sustainable regenerative agricultural practices femi focusing future food how make our food systems more robust what technological solutions you seeing impressing you thinking obviously what else there stuti when comes food system have lot solutions already going start first mechanization indian agriculture mechanized today you compare western europe talking about there still big role simpler solutions like tractors other hand think more about things you thinking real new technologies like talking about you know farm level use data about soil about crops about weather maybe potentially helping farmers make better decisions space some buzzwords you might hear like vertical farming precision agriculture even little robots can plant seeds into ground but big issue here lot these technologies not yet scale there lot funding required get them right cost level think maybe most interesting one right now which really tangible probably use really reducing food waste thirty percent food produce never gets consumed can use technology things like dynamic pricing retailers people buy before goes waste you can look how you can maintain right conditions transport those kinds things think get maybe most excited because you see really tangibly quickly femi one jobs you planning strategy you were talk policymakers business leaders about building better food system what would you tell them stuti think what needs happen lot more figuring out these solutions together finding new ways funding changes need when comes farming example lot subsidized right there lot agricultural policy exists around globe because farmers really important part each country landscape think there big role government there you know they can make those decisions around what incentivize what subsidize what penalize you see there already some experimentation right there sugar taxes brazil denmark going try out carbon tax dairy beef wonder how some these things going play out see there really strong piece there governments can control mix right real balance how you make sure farmers can actually have good successful livelihood same time how start shift better food system big problem lot these things hey first mover taking cost might not see results investment quite some time somebody else takes benefit creating level playing field making easier also take these sustainable steps big part well lizzie building bit when you talking about being first mover steps don pay off immediately some practices rob talked about have longer time horizon wonder how business leader can take those steps bring their shareholders very key constituency along them when maybe there isn immediate payoff show quickly stuti end you need have vision you need create vision your shareholders why you need what some big issues you going face when comes food system think there now pretty clear evidence need make these changes you can use resilience key point maybe first step even just starting educational aspect right making sure you understand what your climate risk exposure what exposure upstream your shareholders start understand risk well you can show hey these actions need take timeframe payoff honestly going really depend each individual company how they make those decisions really tied where they see those opportunities but want say here mean think about energy transition way panned out electric vehicles right knew about technology very long time existing companies didn take action took new player like tesla come they have made mint off right those opportunities there need see who figures out femi think about securing future food conversation all involved nobody opts out because not our business because all have eat all use food systems but you non food business how should you thinking about future our food systems what relevant stuti think there lot actually really spoken guess more about core food companies right but supporting entire system you have banks you have insurance companies you got manufacturing companies providing those tractors spoke about somewhere earlier yeah there actually lot different players around whole space consumer side there also healthcare course because what you eat has effect what your health looks like there infrastructure aspect because when comes food systems hey your food gets stuck port you got lot waste happening think there lot different roles play here more companies can actually find those new ways working together think more likely get transition change really take place lizzie stuti when you thinking about future food food systems what you most excited stuti think idea rethinking system redesigning what now quite complicated actually think some point started looking into journey typical tomato you realize these things going back forth across globe get where they could scratch how would set whole system can benefit way produce our food way works nature what gets excited lizzie stuti thank you much talking today stuti thanks conversation was lot fun femi got such clear idea futurism listening rob chatting stuti because think often think about technology our future technology they were thinking about something basic all have which eat our food systems but projecting how need thinking about them there was moment where stuti mentioned don make hops climate resilient where beer going come lizzie where beer wasn just only person perked was like femi maybe how should talking about future our food systems because will really hit home about how important our food systems lizzie think there were two specific things stuck was episode lot really intriguing specifics rob talking about how few edible plants actually cultivate eat was really fascinating femi shocking lizzie truly shocking then idea stuti put forward you could use something like reduce food waste injecting dynamic pricing right end day come get your tomatoes corn what have you cheap because don want waste brilliant simple femi well brings end
