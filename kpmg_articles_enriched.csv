Global supply chains have entered a phase of significant realignment, with the U.S. imposing tariffs on nearly all its trading partners, resulting in countries once again adjusting to fresh disruptions. The chemical industry—a vital part of critical supply chains and valued at almost USD6 trillion—is now facing an increasingly complex environment.1
Today, a wide range of chemical products, produced by converting raw materials like water, minerals and fossil fuels, serve as essential inputs for a wide range of industries central to modern life. Any disruptions here can cause ripple effects across multiple sectors—such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, metal and mining and electronics—creating bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
But while there are challenges, there are also clear opportunities. For a developing economy like India, which currently benefits from a comparatively lower tariff exposure, this shifting landscape offers room to grow and capture new markets.
Valued at over USD220 billion and spanning more than 80,000 commercial products, India’s chemical industry serves as a core engine of economic growth.2Among its Asian peers, India ranks as the third-largest chemical producer.3On the global front, it stands sixth in overall output and 14th in chemical exports.4
With the U.S.’s potential 26 per cent tariffs on India, trade prospects, however, remain uncertain.5Currently, the U.S. accounts for 18 per cent—or close to USD6 billion—of India’s total chemical exports and the tariff hike could notably impact this high volume of trade.6
To navigate this challenge, India needs to act with agility and foresight. At present, there is an advantage in our current tariff position. For instance, India exported almost USD4 billion worth of organic chemicals to the U.S.7, compared to China’s USD9 billion.8The potential tariff advantage that India has over its Asian counterparts can give our exporters an edge, which is an opportunity to grow market share in a disrupted landscape.
At the same time, India can diversify beyond the U.S. market. We can consider widening our trade horizons and exploring high-potential markets. Take Brazil, for instance. While we currently export approximately USD2 billion worth of chemicals, our potential there is estimated to be around USD3.5 billion.9Similarly, there’s unrealised export potential of more than USD2 billion with China, USD1 billion with Germany and about USD560 billion with the UAE.10
While new market opportunities are welcome news, the next step is to strengthen our domestic chemical manufacturing base, which can make us more capable and better positioned to capitalise on our advantages.
First, one of the biggest hurdles for India’s chemical exporters today is navigating a complex web of regulations and standards. For instance, complying with international standards like the U.S.’s Toxic Substances Control Act and the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals can be both costly and time consuming due to lack of necessary infrastructure and a skilled workforce trained to navigate through complex regulatory requirements. To ease this burden, India can look to build strong compliance management systems that can simplify processes like documentation, approvals and certification. Besides, exporters can also work closely with industry bodies to voice their concerns and engage with policymakers, pushing for a more streamlined and easy regulatory landscape.
Second, India’s high dependence on the import of chemicals and input goods leads to longer lead times and pricing challenges, making chemical exports less competitive. Besides, India has been active in imposing anti-dumping duties to protect the domestic industry from cheap imports. While these duties serve an important purpose, they can also push up input costs for domestic manufacturers and lead to supply chain disruptions. As goods become more expensive, they lose their edge in competitive markets, making it harder for Indian exporters to retain demand and also capture market share. To address this, India can identify critical input materials, such as intermediates and specialty chemicals, that are essential for domestic chemical manufacturers and focus on building their domestic supply chains. Investing in the right infrastructure and building robust value chains can help in reducing import dependence. Along with this, while imposing anti-dumping duties, the government can consider striking a balance between protecting local producers and ensuring that the industry does not face high input costs or supply shortages.
Lastly, India faces stiff competition from leading global chemical manufacturers like the U.S. and China, who lead in both production and exports.11To compete on that scale, India needs to boost its global competitiveness by investing more in technology and R&D. We can take lessons from global best practices to match the innovation and scale of these top global players. For instance, China has developed an extensive network of over 600 chemical parks.12In comparison, India has four Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemical Investment Regions.13Going ahead, the government can accelerate the development of such specialised industrial zones, which can also help in boosting R&D and accelerating tech integration across the sector. Additionally, the private sector can also increase innovation investments. Currently, some of the larger specialty chemical companies in India spend less than 3 per cent of their revenue towards R&D activities, which can be increased to enhance technological upgradations.14
Besides, to strengthen the domestic value chains—especially for critical input materials—the government can enhance support to the MSME sector by making credit more affordable, lowering interest rates and easing collateral norms. Given the capital-intensive nature of the chemical industry, these measures can make our domestic manufacturing ecosystem more competitive and resilient.
There is adversity. But there is also opportunity. India can play on its strengths while also addressing underlying manufacturing challenges to capture a larger market, helping the chemical sector turn current disruptions into long-term gains.

In today’s hyper-connected digital landscape, applications are the lifeline of organisations. They enable critical operations, foster smooth customer interactions, and ignite innovation. Whether it's facilitating financial transactions, managing customer relationships, optimising supply chains, or analysing data, applications are the backbone of business processes. Business applications house sensitive data such as intellectual property, customer information, and financial records, making them critical assets that require robust protection.
Business applications are prime targets for cyberattacks, including sophisticated zero-day exploits, injection attacks, cross-site scripting, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and more. A successful attack on business applications could lead to catastrophic consequences such as financial losses, operational disruptions, reputational damage, and even regulatory penalties. In some cases, a single compromised application can act as a launchpad for attackers, enabling lateral movement across the network and escalating the scope of the attack.
Security operations centres (SOCs) have seldom focussed on application monitoring and have traditionally prioritised infrastructure and security components for log ingestion and monitoring. Similarly, the threat detection use cases or the rules are heavily focussed on infrastructure and security component’s events.
However, as SOCs mature, application security log insights have emerged as one of the most important sources of intelligence. When monitored and analysed effectively, these logs provide actionable insights that empower SOCs to detect threats early, respond swiftly to incidents, and maintain operational continuity. This coverage or visibility also provides consumer assurance in many cases across B2C and B2B applications.
Organisations often struggle with challenges such as the sheer volume, inadequate logging of applications, applications ability to record topics of interest, complexity of log data, the integration of disparate systems, and the need for advanced technology . This document delves into the strategic importance of application security log monitoring, its challenges, leading practices, and emerging trends, illustrating how it is critical in the modern-day security operations.

In today’s hyper-connected digital landscape, 
applications are the lifeline of organisations. They enable 
critical operations, foster smooth customer interactions, 
and ignite innovation. Whether it's facilitating financial 
transactions, managing customer relationships, 
optimising supply chains, or analysing data, applications 
are the backbone of business processes. Business 
applications house sensitive data such as intellectual 
property, customer information, and financial records, 
making them critical assets that require robust 
protection.
Business applications are prime targets for cyberattacks, 
including sophisticated zero-day exploits, injection 
attacks, cross-site scripting, distributed denial-of-service 
(DDoS) attacks, and more. A successful attack on 
business applications could lead to catastrophic 
consequences such as financial losses, operational 
disruptions, reputational damage, and even regulatory 
penalties. In some cases, a single compromised 
application can act as a launchpad for attackers, 
enabling lateral movement across the network and 
escalating the scope of the attack.
Security operations centres (SOCs) have seldom 
focussed on application monitoring and have traditionally 
prioritised infrastructure and security components for log 
ingestion and monitoring. Similarly, the threat detection 
use cases or the rules are heavily focussed on 
infrastructure and security component’s events. 
However, as SOCs mature, application security log 
insights have emerged as one of the most important 
sources of intelligence. When monitored and analysed 
effectively, these logs provide actionable insights that 
empower SOCs to detect threats early, respond swiftly to 
incidents, and maintain operational continuity. This 
coverage or visibility also provides consumer assurance 
in many cases across B2C and B2B applications
Organisations often struggle with challenges such as the 
sheer volume, inadequate logging of applications, 
applications ability to record topics of interest, complexity 
of log data, the integration of disparate systems, and the 
need for advanced technology . This document delves 
into the strategic importance of application security log 
monitoring, its challenges, leading practices, and 
emerging trends, illustrating how it is critical in the 
modern-day security operations.
1. Introduction

KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved.
Application security log monitoring comes with its own challenges. SOCs face numerous obstacles in extracting 
actionable intelligence from the vast sea of application data spread across different architectural layers. Some of 
these challenges are listed below
2. Challenges in application security log monitoring
Data overload
Modern applications generate tremendous volume of 
logs across all layers, from the application layer to 
the network and infrastructure layers. Collecting, 
storing, and performing real-time analysis on this vast 
amount of data is resource-intensive and requires 
significant computational power. The sheer volume of 
logs can overwhelm traditional storage and 
processing systems, leading to delays in threat 
detection and response
Lack of application context 
Often, there is a disconnect between application 
teams and security teams, which hinders the security 
team’s ability to fully understand the application 
context. This disconnect can lead to difficulties in 
devising appropriate and effective detection 
engineering and response strategies
Gaps in threat visibility
Gaining comprehensive visibility into all layers of an 
application is a complex task. Each layer of the 
application architecture generates its own set of logs 
and data points (applications systems, middleware, 
databased). Without correlating these logs from 
various layers, it becomes difficult to obtain a holistic 
view of potential threats. This lack of integrated 
visibility can result in blind spots where threats can 
go undetected
Custom log formats 
Diverse and non-standard log formats present a 
significant challenge for integration and makes 
parsing difficult. Each application may generate logs 
in unique formats, which complicates the process of 
normalising and aggregating data across multiple 
systems. This lack of standardisation makes it 
difficult to create unified views and correlations, 
ultimately hindering the effectiveness of threat 
detection and analysis
Insufficient information
Even after integrating application logs with threat 
detection platforms, the data obtained can be 
fragmented and sometimes unusable. This is often 
because security considerations were not fully 
integrated during the application development phase, 
resulting in logs that lack crucial details needed for 
effective threat detection
Custom threat detection logics
Developing tailored threat detection logics for specific 
applications is an intricate process. It demands not 
only deep domain expertise but also significant time 
and resources. Additionally, keeping these custom 
logics up to date with evolving threats requires 
continuous monitoring, research, and adjustment, 
further contributing to the challenge. Also, as 
application enhancements are implemented, there is 
a need to relook at logging and detection logics 
necessary to detect advanced threats.
To overcome these challenges, SOCs must adopt a 
combination of controls including secure Software 
Development Life Cycle (SDLC) processes, 
documenting logging requirements as part of non-
functional requirements documents (NFR) as well as 
adopting relevant tools and methodologies. Effective 
application security log monitoring transforms reactive 
approaches, into proactive defences by leveraging data 
across all layers.

Application logs are far more than simple records of activity, they are invaluable sources of intelligence. Each layer of 
an application generates distinct logs, and collectively, they provide SOCs with unparalleled visibility into an 
application’s health and security posture. Integrating application logs into a security information and event 
management (SIEM) system is crucial for enhancing the visibility of a Security Operations Centre (SOC). This 
integration not only centralises security monitoring, but also provides comprehensive insights, enabling advanced 
threat detection and streamlined incident response.
3. The value of application logs: Uncovering hidden insights
Key benefits of integrating application logs into SIEM can include
•
Enhanced visibility: By integrating application logs 
within SOC threat detection technologies like SIEM, 
organisations can achieve a unified view of their 
security landscape. This holistic perspective allows 
SOC analysts to seamlessly analyse security signals 
from various layers and actively hunt for threats 
•
Improved correlation and threat detection: SIEM 
solutions helps in correlating events from multiple 
sources to detect cyber-attacks. When application 
logs are integrated, the threat detection quality is 
further enhanced as it can correlate logs from various 
layers of application to precisely detect threats. This 
also provides enriched alert data for an SOC analyst 
to take informed decisions
•
Accelerated incident response: Centralising 
application logs within a SIEM enables faster incident 
investigation and response. SOC teams can quickly 
access relevant log data to understand the scope and 
impact of an incident, facilitating prompt remediation 
•
Regulatory compliance and reporting: Many 
regulatory frameworks require organisations to 
maintain detailed logs of application activities. 
Integrating these logs into a SIEM simplifies 
compliance by providing automated reporting and 
audit trails
•
Operational insights and performance 
monitoring: Beyond security, analysing application 
logs through a SIEM offers valuable operational 
insights. Organisations can monitor application 
performance, detect system errors, and optimise 
resource utilisation 
•
Advanced use cases
-
Anomaly detection/behavioural analytics: By 
establishing baselines of normal application 
behaviour, SIEMs can detect deviations that may 
indicate a potential threat. This helps in identifying 
patterns that may precede security incidents. 
Enhances the capability of User and Entity 
Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) solutions by providing 
more details on user activities across applications 
Importing RBAC as reference tables in SIEM can 
enhance behavioral detection 
-
AI-based threat detection: Integrating 
application logs into a SIEM lays the foundation 
for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and 
machine learning (ML) into threat detection and 
anomalies that may indicate potential security 
threats. By learning from historical data, these 
systems can predict and detect threats before they 
materialise, enhancing the organisation's proactive 
defence capabilities.

Conduct Threat Modelling
Assess the applications in scope and understand their 
business context. Study the application architecture, 
infrastructure components, security controls related to 
the application. Work with stakeholders of the application 
and come up with a data flow diagram, clearly capturing 
application components, data flows, and user 
interactions, trust boundaries, etc. Use frameworks like 
Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information 
Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege 
(STRIDE), Process for Attack Simulation and Threat 
Analysis (PASTA), MITRE ATT&CK to structure threat 
modelling. 
For each identified threat, determine which components 
could generate logs that would help detect/investigate on 
the threat. These components can be spread across 
various layers of the application architecture. Check if 
the log sources are integrated with the SIEM,
Assess if the log data received from the log sources are 
sufficient for detecting and investigating the identified 
threats, Develop high level logic to detect the identified 
threats. and revisit the threat model periodically as 
applications evolve to see if new threats emerge. 
Incorporate threat modelling as a fundamental part of the 
software development lifecycle process, if not already 
done.
Log collection
Validate if the log sources identified as part of the threat 
modelling exercise are integrated with the SIEM. Initiate 
the integration of log sources that are not currently 
sending logs to the SIEM system. Ensure that all the 
necessary data required for threat detection and 
investigation is present in the logs sent from these log 
sources. 
Create necessary parsers to normalise these logs into a 
common schema to facilitate enhanced correlation and 
querying. Also common taxonomy can help cross 
application co-relation. Enrich the logs with contextual 
information to improve the threat detection and 
investigation capabilities.
Embed the application security log ingestion steps as 
part of your broader log source management process.
Identify potential threat scenarios 
targeting the applications 
Prioritise threat scenarios to 
mitigate 
Assess risks based on impact and 
likelihood
Develop mitigation strategies.

Utilise the insights gained from the threat modelling 
activity to develop contextual threat detection use 
cases/rules in line with the threat scenarios identified. 
Leverage the logs collected from various layers of the 
application to enable cross correlation and detect 
advance threats.
Develop threat detection use cases that emphasise 
threat behaviour rather than relying solely on signatures, 
fixed values, or atomic indicators. This approach focuses 
on the underlying tactics, techniques, and patterns 
adversaries use, enabling a more adaptive and resilient 
defence against evolving threats.
It is equally important to develop contextual response 
plan for the threat scenarios identified. The response 
plan should be carefully tailored to align the specific 
characteristics of the application in question, ensuring 
that the response is both effective and relevant to the 
operational environment. 
It's critical to create standardised playbooks that 
automate the response plan, ensuring a swift and 
coordinated approach to incident management. By 
identifying and implementing automation for 
straightforward response actions, you can significantly 
reduce response times, eradicate manual errors, and 
more effectively contain threats before they escalate.
Involve the SOC analysts and triage specialist as part of 
the use case and playbook testing. Ensure to incorporate 
relevant feedback from various SOC teams before 
moving the use cases and play books into production.
It is important to document the use cases and playbooks 
with relevant details and store it in the use case/playbook 
library. These use cases and playbooks need to be 
reviewed and updated periodically to ensure it stays 
relevant.

utilised to perform threat analysis, threat hunting. 
Overview of the use cases created along the associated 
threat detection logic. Provide training on the response 
playbook workflow and how it can be leveraged for swift 
and precise threat response
Active defence approach
In addition to traditional SOC monitoring based on alerts 
triggered in the SIEM console, encourage the team to 
perform proactive threat hunting using the application 
intelligence brought into the SIEM solution as part of this 
engagement. With insights coming in from various layers 
of the application, it is essential for SOC analysts and 
threat hunters to dig deep and uncover suspicious 
patterns that could lead to a successful attack or 
compromise. This approach helps the SOC identify and 
counter threats at an earlier stage and enhance the 
threat detection use cases and response workflows
Advanced analytics
As part of application security logs integration, we are 
collecting invaluable intelligence from various layers of 
the application in the form of logs. This rich dataset 
serves as a critical input for AI/ML models to learn and 
detect abnormal behaviours and suspicious patterns.
Continuous analysis of these security logs using 
advanced analytics enables the prediction of emerging 
threats. By identifying trends and behaviour anomalies 
before they fully manifest, these models can help defend 
against cyber-attacks and reduce overall risk. This shift 
in analytics could help transform traditional security 
operations centres into next-generation security 
operations centres with predictive threat intelligence 
capabilities.

In today’s hyper-connected digital landscape, 
applications are the lifeline of organisations. They enable 
critical operations, foster smooth customer interactions, 
and ignite innovation. Whether it's facilitating financial 
transactions, managing customer relationships, 
optimising supply chains, or analysing data, applications 
are the backbone of business processes. Business 
applications house sensitive data such as intellectual 
property, customer information, and financial records, 
making them critical assets that require robust 
protection.
Business applications are prime targets for cyberattacks, 
including sophisticated zero-day exploits, injection 
attacks, cross-site scripting, distributed denial-of-service 
(DDoS) attacks, and more. A successful attack on 
business applications could lead to catastrophic 
consequences such as financial losses, operational 
disruptions, reputational damage, and even regulatory 
penalties. In some cases, a single compromised 
application can act as a launchpad for attackers, 
enabling lateral movement across the network and 
escalating the scope of the attack.
Security operations centres (SOCs) have seldom 
focussed on application monitoring and have traditionally 
prioritised infrastructure and security components for log 
ingestion and monitoring. Similarly, the threat detection 
use cases or the rules are heavily focussed on 
infrastructure and security component’s events. 
However, as SOCs mature, application security log 
insights have emerged as one of the most important 
sources of intelligence. When monitored and analysed 
effectively, these logs provide actionable insights that 
empower SOCs to detect threats early, respond swiftly to 
incidents, and maintain operational continuity. This 
coverage or visibility also provides consumer assurance 
in many cases across B2C and B2B applications
Organisations often struggle with challenges such as the 
sheer volume, inadequate logging of applications, 
applications ability to record topics of interest, complexity 
of log data, the integration of disparate systems, and the 
need for advanced technology . This document delves 
into the strategic importance of application security log 
monitoring, its challenges, leading practices, and 
emerging trends, illustrating how it is critical in the 
modern-day security operations.

Application security log monitoring comes with its own challenges. SOCs face numerous obstacles in extracting 
actionable intelligence from the vast sea of application data spread across different architectural layers. Some of 
these challenges are listed below
2. Challenges in application security log monitoring
Data overload
Modern applications generate tremendous volume of 
logs across all layers, from the application layer to 
the network and infrastructure layers. Collecting, 
storing, and performing real-time analysis on this vast 
amount of data is resource-intensive and requires 
significant computational power. The sheer volume of 
logs can overwhelm traditional storage and 
processing systems, leading to delays in threat 
detection and response
Lack of application context 
Often, there is a disconnect between application 
teams and security teams, which hinders the security 
team’s ability to fully understand the application 
context. This disconnect can lead to difficulties in 
devising appropriate and effective detection 
engineering and response strategies
Gaps in threat visibility
Gaining comprehensive visibility into all layers of an 
application is a complex task. Each layer of the 
application architecture generates its own set of logs 
and data points (applications systems, middleware, 
databased). Without correlating these logs from 
various layers, it becomes difficult to obtain a holistic 
view of potential threats. This lack of integrated 
visibility can result in blind spots where threats can 
go undetected
Custom log formats 
Diverse and non-standard log formats present a 
significant challenge for integration and makes 
parsing difficult. Each application may generate logs 
in unique formats, which complicates the process of 
normalising and aggregating data across multiple 
systems. This lack of standardisation makes it 
difficult to create unified views and correlations, 
ultimately hindering the effectiveness of threat 
detection and analysis
Insufficient information
Even after integrating application logs with threat 
detection platforms, the data obtained can be 
fragmented and sometimes unusable. This is often 
because security considerations were not fully 
integrated during the application development phase, 
resulting in logs that lack crucial details needed for 
effective threat detection
Custom threat detection logics
Developing tailored threat detection logics for specific 
applications is an intricate process. It demands not 
only deep domain expertise but also significant time 
and resources. Additionally, keeping these custom 
logics up to date with evolving threats requires 
continuous monitoring, research, and adjustment, 
further contributing to the challenge. Also, as 
application enhancements are implemented, there is 
a need to relook at logging and detection logics 
necessary to detect advanced threats.
To overcome these challenges, SOCs must adopt a 
combination of controls including secure Software 
Development Life Cycle (SDLC) processes, 
documenting logging requirements as part of non-
functional requirements documents (NFR) as well as 
adopting relevant tools and methodologies. Effective 
application security log monitoring transforms reactive 
approaches, into proactive defences by leveraging data 
across all layers.

Application logs are far more than simple records of activity, they are invaluable sources of intelligence. Each layer of 
an application generates distinct logs, and collectively, they provide SOCs with unparalleled visibility into an 
application’s health and security posture. Integrating application logs into a security information and event 
management (SIEM) system is crucial for enhancing the visibility of a Security Operations Centre (SOC). This 
integration not only centralises security monitoring, but also provides comprehensive insights, enabling advanced 
threat detection and streamlined incident response.
3. The value of application logs: Uncovering hidden insights
Key benefits of integrating application logs into SIEM can include
•
Enhanced visibility: By integrating application logs 
within SOC threat detection technologies like SIEM, 
organisations can achieve a unified view of their 
security landscape. This holistic perspective allows 
SOC analysts to seamlessly analyse security signals 
from various layers and actively hunt for threats 
•
Improved correlation and threat detection: SIEM 
solutions helps in correlating events from multiple 
sources to detect cyber-attacks. When application 
logs are integrated, the threat detection quality is 
further enhanced as it can correlate logs from various 
layers of application to precisely detect threats. This 
also provides enriched alert data for an SOC analyst 
to take informed decisions
•
Accelerated incident response: Centralising 
application logs within a SIEM enables faster incident 
investigation and response. SOC teams can quickly 
access relevant log data to understand the scope and 
impact of an incident, facilitating prompt remediation 
•
Regulatory compliance and reporting: Many 
regulatory frameworks require organisations to 
maintain detailed logs of application activities. 
Integrating these logs into a SIEM simplifies 
compliance by providing automated reporting and 
audit trails
•
Operational insights and performance 
monitoring: Beyond security, analysing application 
logs through a SIEM offers valuable operational 
insights. Organisations can monitor application 
performance, detect system errors, and optimise 
resource utilisation 
•
Advanced use cases
-
Anomaly detection/behavioural analytics: By 
establishing baselines of normal application 
behaviour, SIEMs can detect deviations that may 
indicate a potential threat. This helps in identifying 
patterns that may precede security incidents. 
Enhances the capability of User and Entity 
Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) solutions by providing 
more details on user activities across applications 
Importing RBAC as reference tables in SIEM can 
enhance behavioral detection 
-
AI-based threat detection: Integrating 
application logs into a SIEM lays the foundation 
for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and 
machine learning (ML) into threat detection and 
anomalies that may indicate potential security 
threats. By learning from historical data, these 
systems can predict and detect threats before they 
materialise, enhancing the organisation's proactive 
defence capabilities.

application security log monitoring 
program. Alternatively, update the 
overall SOC objective to 
incorporate application security log 
monitoring
Define objectives
Identify and agree on the 
applications and related 
components to be included in the 
application security log monitoring 
program, based on their impact on 
business and security 
requirements
Define scope
Identify relevant stakeholders from 
various functions who need to be 
part of the engagement. Agree on 
the roles and responsibilities of the 
stakeholders. Develop a project 
plan with realistic timeline and 
milestone for each phase of

Conduct Threat Modelling
Assess the applications in scope and understand their 
business context. Study the application architecture, 
infrastructure components, security controls related to 
the application. Work with stakeholders of the application 
and come up with a data flow diagram, clearly capturing 
application components, data flows, and user 
interactions, trust boundaries, etc. Use frameworks like 
Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information 
Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege 
(STRIDE), Process for Attack Simulation and Threat 
Analysis (PASTA), MITRE ATT&CK to structure threat 
modelling. 
For each identified threat, determine which components 
could generate logs that would help detect/investigate on 
the threat. These components can be spread across 
various layers of the application architecture. Check if 
the log sources are integrated with the SIEM,
Assess if the log data received from the log sources are 
sufficient for detecting and investigating the identified 
threats, Develop high level logic to detect the identified 
threats. and revisit the threat model periodically as 
applications evolve to see if new threats emerge. 
Incorporate threat modelling as a fundamental part of the 
software development lifecycle process, if not already 
done.
Log collection
Validate if the log sources identified as part of the threat 
modelling exercise are integrated with the SIEM. Initiate 
the integration of log sources that are not currently 
sending logs to the SIEM system. Ensure that all the 
necessary data required for threat detection and 
investigation is present in the logs sent from these log 
sources. 
Create necessary parsers to normalise these logs into a 
common schema to facilitate enhanced correlation and 
querying. Also common taxonomy can help cross 
application co-relation. Enrich the logs with contextual 
information to improve the threat detection and 
investigation capabilities.
Embed the application security log ingestion steps as 
part of your broader log source management process.
Identify potential threat scenarios 
targeting the applications 
Prioritise threat scenarios to 
mitigate 
Assess risks based on impact and 
likelihood
Develop mitigation strategies.

Utilise the insights gained from the threat modelling 
activity to develop contextual threat detection use 
cases/rules in line with the threat scenarios identified. 
Leverage the logs collected from various layers of the 
application to enable cross correlation and detect 
advance threats.
Develop threat detection use cases that emphasise 
threat behaviour rather than relying solely on signatures, 
fixed values, or atomic indicators. This approach focuses 
on the underlying tactics, techniques, and patterns 
adversaries use, enabling a more adaptive and resilient 
defence against evolving threats.
It is equally important to develop contextual response 
plan for the threat scenarios identified. The response 
plan should be carefully tailored to align the specific 
characteristics of the application in question, ensuring 
that the response is both effective and relevant to the 
operational environment. 
It's critical to create standardised playbooks that 
automate the response plan, ensuring a swift and 
coordinated approach to incident management. By 
identifying and implementing automation for 
straightforward response actions, you can significantly 
reduce response times, eradicate manual errors, and 
more effectively contain threats before they escalate.
Involve the SOC analysts and triage specialist as part of 
the use case and playbook testing. Ensure to incorporate 
relevant feedback from various SOC teams before 
moving the use cases and play books into production.
It is important to document the use cases and playbooks 
with relevant details and store it in the use case/playbook 
library. These use cases and playbooks need to be 
reviewed and updated periodically to ensure it stays 
relevant.

utilised to perform threat analysis, threat hunting. 
Overview of the use cases created along the associated 
threat detection logic. Provide training on the response 
playbook workflow and how it can be leveraged for swift 
and precise threat response
Active defence approach
In addition to traditional SOC monitoring based on alerts 
triggered in the SIEM console, encourage the team to 
perform proactive threat hunting using the application 
intelligence brought into the SIEM solution as part of this 
engagement. With insights coming in from various layers 
of the application, it is essential for SOC analysts and 
threat hunters to dig deep and uncover suspicious 
patterns that could lead to a successful attack or 
compromise. This approach helps the SOC identify and 
counter threats at an earlier stage and enhance the 
threat detection use cases and response workflows
Advanced analytics
As part of application security logs integration, we are 
collecting invaluable intelligence from various layers of 
the application in the form of logs. This rich dataset 
serves as a critical input for AI/ML models to learn and 
detect abnormal behaviours and suspicious patterns.
Continuous analysis of these security logs using 
advanced analytics enables the prediction of emerging 
threats. By identifying trends and behaviour anomalies 
before they fully manifest, these models can help defend 
against cyber-attacks and reduce overall risk. This shift 
in analytics could help transform traditional security 
operations centres into next-generation security 
operations centres with predictive threat intelligence 
capabilities.

The CISO’s role in the Energy, Natural Resources and Chemicals sector is no longer confined to the traditional scope of IT security
Share
Security across energy, natural resources, and chemicals (ENRC) companies worldwide is being reshaped by an array of factors, including the expanding role of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), the influx of smart/IoT devices, and the imperative to build a resilient culture and network environment, to name just several. In this complex and interconnected environment, many CISOs within this broad sector are facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities as they seek to spur their workforce to an ever-greater level of digital awareness. To do so, they must assume the role of cyber evangelist, motivating and inspiring the organisation, at every level, to move from acknowledgement to action.
The CISO’s role in the ENRC sector is no longer confined to the traditional scope of IT security. Indeed, according to KPMG research, 70 percent of ENRC CEOs agree that cybercrime and cyber insecurity will impact organisational prosperity over the next three years.1With IT and operational technology (OT) converging, CISOs are now tasked with safeguarding the entire technology ecosystem, from the boardroom to the production floor.
This expanded responsibility demands a new set of skills. CISOs must effectively communicate the business impact of cybersecurity to senior leadership, secure adequate budgets, and drive a culture of resilience throughout the organisation. There are signs of positive change in how cybersecurity is becoming more embedded across organisations. In fact, KPMG research has found that, in 59 percent of ENRC organisations, cybersecurity is typically involved from the earliest planning stages of the decision-making process for technology investment and has a high influence.2
Sector-specific challenges add to the complexity of the CISO agenda. The ENRC sector is subject to several intricate regulatory requirements around technology, cyber security and the environment, such as NIS2, NERC CIP and the AI Act Clearly, CISOs must deliver on compliance while also dealing with the specter of geopolitical challenges and growing cyber-attacks, which can have devastating consequences for the organisation, its stakeholders, and the broader society.
In fact, in April 2024, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said the number of vulnerable US power grid points was increasing at a rate of about 60 per day.3In Europe, Denmark’s critical infrastructure experienced the largest cyber attack in its history in May 2023, as 22 companies were breached in a matter of days. Some were forced to enter island mode operation by completely disconnecting from the internet.4
To thrive in this environment, CISOs must embrace a proactive and strategic mindset. They need to push vulnerability management back to the business side and lead by emphasising a risk-based approach characterised by strategic guidance on risks, based on their potential organisational impact. Beyond strategic leadership, a CISO also plays an important role in breaking down the traditional siloes between IT and OT and ensure these teams work together closely to build enduring resilience.
This report explores cybersecurity considerations for the ENRC sector with insights and actionable recommendations. Although not exhaustive, it covers a range of topics that we believe CISOs in the ENRC sector should prioritise in the current environment.
Given the heightened regulatory scrutiny and the strategic importance of cybersecurity, CISOs face increased accountability and, in some cases, personal liability risks. There is more pressure than ever to deliver on strong cybersecurity outcomes in organisations. At the same time, traditional CISO functions have become increasingly dispersed. Various aspects of security and privacy now fall under the purview of other business leaders, such as the Chief Security Officer (CSO) for physical security and fraud, IT infrastructure for perimeter security and identity and access management (IAM), and the Chief Data Officer (CDO) for privacy.
With this, the role of the CISO is poised for a profound shift. CISOs must adapt to this new reality by establishing their scope, partnering with other business leaders, and championing a culture of shared accountability. Growing support from organisational leadership for ongoing cybersecurity investment is helpful in this regard. To that end, KPMG research has found that 72 percent of CEOs at ENRC firms said they have increased their investment in cyber security to protect operations and intellectual property.5
Ultimately, CISOs need to transition from being the sole guardian of cyber security to becoming the architect of a resilient and agile security framework.
Balancing the new cybersecurity order
CISOs in the ENRC sector are facing the consequences of new and uniquely challenging realities such as the climate crisis and the subsequent pressure on increasing sustainability and ESG values, while working with rapidly evolving technology. Moreover, geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, continue to impact supply chains and increase the regulatory burden. Indeed, according to KPMG research, supply chain risk is the joint top threat among CEOs.6What’s more, KPMG research suggests “tectonic shifts in power, economic centers and trade, along with multiple threats to supply chains, assets and infrastructure” are highly impacting ENRC organisations.7
Highly experienced security individuals with a broader range of skills beyond the merely technical, are required to manage this dynamic risk landscape.
Framing cyberthreats as business risks
CISOs must bridge the gap between the C-suite and technical teams by framing cyber risks as business risks. Strategic thinking, negotiation skills, and strong leadership are key enablers here. With sector-specific challenges such as balancing operational continuity with data and information protection, securing the trust of the board is crucial. Operational continuity typically benefits when cyber measures, such as regular patching and appropriate controls, are well-planned and efficiently implemented. Striking a balance between security investments and valuable outcomes helps the board see how this dynamic leads to better security and business risk mitigation.
Regulatory challenges
CISOs face intense scrutiny from regulators to ensure their cybersecurity programs are effective and resilient. Although individual legal liability varies, there is increasing top-down pressure as regulations—notably the U.S. SEC’s Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, which went into effect in late 2023—increasingly hold boards liable for cyber incidents.8
Role distribution in converging environments
The convergence of IT and OT blurs traditional role boundaries, requiring CISOs to have both technical and strategic expertise. Clear distinctions between operations and security are crucial to avoid gaps and ensure secure digitalisation strategies.
CISOs can position themselves as strategic partners with crucial board access and influence on business goals. Since CISOs are usually not board members, clear and direct reporting lines to C-Suite executives can enable regular communication with the board.
Encouraging collaboration between security and operational teams allows the CISO to take a leading role. Integrating domains like physical security, compliance, privacy, and operations creates a holistic approach to risk management. This alignment supports business objectives and enhances resilience by bridging technical and operational gaps.CISOs in the energy sector must balance the urgent need for sustainability transitions with the need to safeguard critical infrastructure. This is particularly crucial as many continue to explore solutions such as AI-powered predictive maintenance, advanced energy storage solutions, and smart grids. Slowly integrating these technologies alongside legacy systems can help ensure both short- and long-term operational continuity.As these cognitive-based applications proliferate, CISOs must carefully weigh the advantages of innovation against potential security risks, relying on data-driven assessments to quantify threats and justify investments. CISOs need to align the adoption of emerging technologies with business objectives and use data-driven insights to quantify risks and justify investments. This approach can help secure stakeholder buy-in and ensure the sustainability of the cybersecurity program.
The rapid proliferation of smart devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed the modern power grid into a vast, interconnected network of sensors and software that requires a fundamental shift in how CISOs at ENRC companies approach the security of digital devices. For example, smart sensors, meters, and grids—which often have limited security features—can be accessible entry points to legacy operational technology systems, greatly expanding the potential attack surface.
The security approach required for these devices is vastly different from the methods used just a decade ago. CISOs must now consider the entire lifecycle of these smart products, from design and development to deployment and maintenance. Security strategies need to consider the broader supply chain and ecosystem in which these devices operate.
With the introduction of regulatory standards such as NIS2, the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), the AI Act, and ISA/IEC 62443, CISOs across the ENRC sector need to comply with new requirements while contending with potential impacts. Additionally, geopolitical trends, such as those mentioned above and the rise of alliances between nations and hacktivist groups, continue to impact the security of digital products and expand the attack surface for critical infrastructure. CISOs need to be prepared for these dynamics and adapt their strategies accordingly.
Data management and privacy
Smart devices in the ENRC sector generate vast datasets for critical functions like predictive maintenance and energy optimisation. These devices typically are lacking in security standards and often have poor authentication and encryption capabilities, which increases the potential for breaches, unauthorised access, and data manipulation, along with privacy risks and compliance challenges.
Interoperability and integration between legacy systems and smart products
Many ENRC organisations use legacy systems not designed for internet connectivity or integration with modern smart technologies. This creates security gaps when these systems are retrofitted with IoT devices and smart products. The integration of renewable energy technologies adds complexity and increases cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
Secure lifecycle and third parties
Ensuring the security and resilience of connected devices like smart meters and grid sensors throughout their lifecycle is crucial. The energy sector's dependence on a vast supply chain adds risks since vulnerabilities in third-party products can compromise entire systems.
Widespread adoption of smart products can enhance efficiency, service, and reliability. Greater quantities of data can be gathered, analysed, and utilised to benefit operations and customers.
IoT sensors can be used to analyse real-time operational data and monitor equipment to detect issues early. This can reduce downtime and maintenance costs while extending asset life. For demand forecasting, smart technologies analyse patterns and trends to optimise resource allocation, grid management, and renewable energy integration for reliable supply-demand balance.
Regulations like the NIS2 and CRA are enhancing cybersecurity for smart devices by mandating stricter security standards, risk assessments, and compliance. They’ll drive secure-by-design principles and supply chain integrity. Devices in critical operations, such as smart grids and industrial IoT, must meet rigorous standards for secure communication, patching, and incident response.ENRC organisations are proactively embracing smart technologies to drive improvements in efficiency, sustainability, and operational reliability. These include blockchain and Web3 technologies to enable decentralised energy systems and facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading. Grid operators are making strategic investments in smart grid technologies, deploying advanced sensors, real-time data analytics, and demand response systems to optimise energy distribution and seamlessly integrate renewable sources.Moreover, energy-efficient buildings are making use of smart sensors, IoT devices, and advanced insulation to minimize energy consumption, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and curb carbon emissions. These cutting-edge technologies empower utilities and consumers with enhanced control over energy use, resulting in improved power grid operations and reduced costs.
The increasing reliance on IoT and OT systems, coupled with the growing sophistication of cyber threats targeting industrial control systems, means that CISOs responsible for critical infrastructure and resources at ENRC companies face multiple challenges. The potential for large-scale disruption, putting both human lives and data at risk, is a sobering reality. Moreover, heightened regulatory scrutiny on the security and resilience of critical infrastructure has added another layer of complexity to an already daunting task.
With threats to ENRC infrastructure, such as breaches to SCADA systems, grid attacks, and pipeline disruptions, the operational continuity of the sector is heavily challenged. To maintain resilience, CISOs must implement cyber security strategies that focus on preventing disruptions and ensuring rapid recovery in the event of an incident. This includes real-time monitoring, attack surface management, incident response planning, and championing a resilience-first culture across teams.
The evolving regulatory landscape, particularly NIS2 and NERC CIP, reinforces the need for strong cybersecurity practices to safeguard both physical and digital assets. By prioritising resilience, ENRC organisations can reduce vulnerabilities and remain operationally sound in the face of sophisticated cyber threats.
Through this posture, CISOs can position themselves as strategic business enablers whose work makes organisations not only more resilient but also competitive.
Digital transformation risks
The drive towards digital transformation by connecting old OT systems to online networks is exposing often insecure legacy systems to internet-based threats. Additionally, the deployment of IoT devices in energy systems, from smart meters to remote sensors in offshore wind farms and power grids, is expanding the attack surface significantly. These devices often lack strong security measures and are vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. The interconnectivity also risks cascading failures, making containment of incidents more challenging.
Renewable energy infrastructure vulnerabilities
Many parts of renewable energy infrastructure are vulnerable as most of them have a digital interface and allow for remote monitoring. Incorporating Wi-Fi-enabled IoT devices adds to the vulnerability.
Complex and evolving resilience regulations
The lack of harmonised regional and international cybersecurity standards makes compliance challenging for ENRC organisations, especially as critical infrastructure providers. For multinational companies, navigating conflicting or overlapping regulations across jurisdictions adds to the complexity. Noncompliance risks hefty fines, reputational damage, and increased scrutiny.
Using advanced threat detection tools, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and intrusion detection/prevention systems will be critical. The use of ML/AI to recognise and predict malicious behavior can enable quicker identification and response to cyber threats in both IT and OT environments.
Regulations like the NIS2 Directive require sector cooperation and third-party risk management. They require organisations to be in control of supply chain risks, making it imperative to monitor the cybersecurity posture of key suppliers. Sharing threat intelligence and collaborating with other companies and governmental agencies can help energy companies stay ahead of emerging cyber threats. Establishing partnerships with trusted cybersecurity vendors helps with rapid response and incident support.
Modern cyber resilience training options include virtual reality (VR) for immersive crisis simulations, AI-driven adaptive scenarios for personalised learning, and gamified platforms to engage and train employees and operators in interactive incident response exercises. This can improve response and resilience capabilities.ENRC organisations, as critical infrastructure, should adopt new technologies carefully.
As the threat landscape expands, organisations should take the time to understand the risks and exposures cyber insurance may cover. Companies can seek to capture losses related to third-party outages and remediate the impact through rate reductions, insurance or litigation.
Proactively identifying risks and developing the capability to recover rapidly from significant cyber incidents remains an area of focus for CISOs in the sector.
A KPMG firm was tasked with enhancing a client's capability to recover from a worst-case cyber scenario and developing a tool to help them re-evaluate their most business-critical applications. The primary objective was to provide the client, an energy distributor, with an extensive playbook featuring detailed processes, procedures, and step-by-step instructions to follow in the event of a complete loss of IT capability. Additionally, the client needed a method for identifying their most critical business processes.
Collaborating with key global business stakeholders, the KPMG team worked to gain a deep understanding of the client's existing internal recovery processes. Leveraging KPMG's industry knowledge and experience, the team meticulously populated the playbook with actionable steps for the client to recover their IT systems from zero.Furthermore, KPMG designed and developed a tool that enabled the client to reclassify their business-critical applications. Over time, the criteria for identifying these applications had become outdated, leading to the misclassification of several non-critical applications as business critical. The tool assessed various types of data collected in business impact analyses (BIAs) and allowed the client to re-order the criticality of their applications.
Through this engagement the client was able to implement processes aimed at reducing downtime and business loss in the event of a total IT capability loss. Additionally, the client gained a clearer understanding of the criticality of their business applications and processes, ensuring better preparedness and resilience against cyber threats.
Given the extensive supply chains and interconnected IT and OT systems, security needs to remain top of mind. Rapid adoption without the right guardrails can increase vulnerabilities, making organisations targets for cyberattacks. However, ENRC organisations clearly are becoming better prepared. They are using AI and machine learning for predictive maintenance and threat detection, blockchain for secure transactions, high-performance computing and IoT for real-time monitoring, and secure-by-design principles for increased security. Additionally, cloud security solutions and centralised cybersecurity governance can help manage and secure data effectively.

These devices typically are lacking in security standards and often have poor authentication and encryption capabilities, which increases the potential for breaches, unauthorised access, and data manipulation, along with privacy risks and compliance challenges.
Interoperability and integration between legacy systems and smart products
Many ENRC organisations use legacy systems not designed for internet connectivity or integration with modern smart technologies. This creates security gaps when these systems are retrofitted with IoT devices and smart products. The integration of renewable energy technologies adds complexity and increases cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
Secure lifecycle and third parties
Ensuring the security and resilience of connected devices like smart meters and grid sensors throughout their lifecycle is crucial. The energy sector's dependence on a vast supply chain adds risks since vulnerabilities in third-party products can compromise entire systems.
Widespread adoption of smart products can enhance efficiency, service, and reliability. Greater quantities of data can be gathered, analysed, and utilised to benefit operations and customers.
IoT sensors can be used to analyse real-time operational data and monitor equipment to detect issues early. This can reduce downtime and maintenance costs while extending asset life. For demand forecasting, smart technologies analyse patterns and trends to optimise resource allocation, grid management, and renewable energy integration for reliable supply-demand balance.
Regulations like the NIS2 and CRA are enhancing cybersecurity for smart devices by mandating stricter security standards, risk assessments, and compliance. They’ll drive secure-by-design principles and supply chain integrity. Devices in critical operations, such as smart grids and industrial IoT, must meet rigorous standards for secure communication, patching, and incident response.ENRC organisations are proactively embracing smart technologies to drive improvements in efficiency, sustainability, and operational reliability. These include blockchain and Web3 technologies to enable decentralised energy systems and facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading. Grid operators are making strategic investments in smart grid technologies, deploying advanced sensors, real-time data analytics, and demand response systems to optimise energy distribution and seamlessly integrate renewable sources.Moreover, energy-efficient buildings are making use of smart sensors, IoT devices, and advanced insulation to minimize energy consumption, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and curb carbon emissions. These cutting-edge technologies empower utilities and consumers with enhanced control over energy use, resulting in improved power grid operations and reduced costs.
The increasing reliance on IoT and OT systems, coupled with the growing sophistication of cyber threats targeting industrial control systems, means that CISOs responsible for critical infrastructure and resources at ENRC companies face multiple challenges. The potential for large-scale disruption, putting both human lives and data at risk, is a sobering reality. Moreover, heightened regulatory scrutiny on the security and resilience of critical infrastructure has added another layer of complexity to an already daunting task.
With threats to ENRC infrastructure, such as breaches to SCADA systems, grid attacks, and pipeline disruptions, the operational continuity of the sector is heavily challenged. To maintain resilience, CISOs must implement cyber security strategies that focus on preventing disruptions and ensuring rapid recovery in the event of an incident. This includes real-time monitoring, attack surface management, incident response planning, and championing a resilience-first culture across teams.
The evolving regulatory landscape, particularly NIS2 and NERC CIP, reinforces the need for strong cybersecurity practices to safeguard both physical and digital assets. By prioritising resilience, ENRC organisations can reduce vulnerabilities and remain operationally sound in the face of sophisticated cyber threats.
Through this posture, CISOs can position themselves as strategic business enablers whose work makes organisations not only more resilient but also competitive.
Digital transformation risks
The drive towards digital transformation by connecting old OT systems to online networks is exposing often insecure legacy systems to internet-based threats. Additionally, the deployment of IoT devices in energy systems, from smart meters to remote sensors in offshore wind farms and power grids, is expanding the attack surface significantly. These devices often lack strong security measures and are vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. The interconnectivity also risks cascading failures, making containment of incidents more challenging.
Renewable energy infrastructure vulnerabilities
Many parts of renewable energy infrastructure are vulnerable as most of them have a digital interface and allow for remote monitoring. Incorporating Wi-Fi-enabled IoT devices adds to the vulnerability.
Complex and evolving resilience regulations
The lack of harmonised regional and international cybersecurity standards makes compliance challenging for ENRC organisations, especially as critical infrastructure providers. For multinational companies, navigating conflicting or overlapping regulations across jurisdictions adds to the complexity. Noncompliance risks hefty fines, reputational damage, and increased scrutiny.
Using advanced threat detection tools, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and intrusion detection/prevention systems will be critical. The use of ML/AI to recognise and predict malicious behavior can enable quicker identification and response to cyber threats in both IT and OT environments.
Regulations like the NIS2 Directive require sector cooperation and third-party risk management. They require organisations to be in control of supply chain risks, making it imperative to monitor the cybersecurity posture of key suppliers. Sharing threat intelligence and collaborating with other companies and governmental agencies can help energy companies stay ahead of emerging cyber threats. Establishing partnerships with trusted cybersecurity vendors helps with rapid response and incident support.
Modern cyber resilience training options include virtual reality (VR) for immersive crisis simulations, AI-driven adaptive scenarios for personalised learning, and gamified platforms to engage and train employees and operators in interactive incident response exercises. This can improve response and resilience capabilities.ENRC organisations, as critical infrastructure, should adopt new technologies carefully.
As the threat landscape expands, organisations should take the time to understand the risks and exposures cyber insurance may cover. Companies can seek to capture losses related to third-party outages and remediate the impact through rate reductions, insurance or litigation.
Proactively identifying risks and developing the capability to recover rapidly from significant cyber incidents remains an area of focus for CISOs in the sector.
A KPMG firm was tasked with enhancing a client's capability to recover from a worst-case cyber scenario and developing a tool to help them re-evaluate their most business-critical applications. The primary objective was to provide the client, an energy distributor, with an extensive playbook featuring detailed processes, procedures, and step-by-step instructions to follow in the event of a complete loss of IT capability. Additionally, the client needed a method for identifying their most critical business processes.
Collaborating with key global business stakeholders, the KPMG team worked to gain a deep understanding of the client's existing internal recovery processes. Leveraging KPMG's industry knowledge and experience, the team meticulously populated the playbook with actionable steps for the client to recover their IT systems from zero.Furthermore, KPMG designed and developed a tool that enabled the client to reclassify their business-critical applications. Over time, the criteria for identifying these applications had become outdated, leading to the misclassification of several non-critical applications as business critical. The tool assessed various types of data collected in business impact analyses (BIAs) and allowed the client to re-order the criticality of their applications.
Through this engagement the client was able to implement processes aimed at reducing downtime and business loss in the event of a total IT capability loss. Additionally, the client gained a clearer understanding of the criticality of their business applications and processes, ensuring better preparedness and resilience against cyber threats.
Given the extensive supply chains and interconnected IT and OT systems, security needs to remain top of mind. Rapid adoption without the right guardrails can increase vulnerabilities, making organisations targets for cyberattacks. However, ENRC organisations clearly are becoming better prepared. They are using AI and machine learning for predictive maintenance and threat detection, blockchain for secure transactions, high-performance computing and IoT for real-time monitoring, and secure-by-design principles for increased security. Additionally, cloud security solutions and centralised cybersecurity governance can help manage and secure data effectively.

India has displayed steady and robust economic growth while facing global challenges and geopolitical concerns and it continues to maintain its position as the fastest-growing major economy. India is estimated to clock in a GDP growth of 6.2 and 6.3 per cent in FY25 and FY26, respectively, backed by strong domestic demand, substantial infrastructure development initiatives, a spike in rural demand and effective government policy measures.
The report underscores a sustained drop in inflation in recent months, shrinking fiscal deficit due to an increase in tax revenue and growth in exports year on year in FY25, highlighting a robust macroeconomic foundation for India. These trends also play a key role in reinforcing economic stability and investor confidence. The manufacturing sector continues to expand sharply despite experiencing a slowdown for over a year, driven by significant domestic and global demand.
Major government initiatives such as Make in India and the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme further boost domestic production and enhance India’s competitiveness. Over the past two decades, India has consistently contributed a sizable share to global activity and growth. The nation continues to cement its position as a sought-after hub for innovation and entrepreneurship with its rapidly expanding startup ecosystem and its status as the world’s third most preferred destination for technology investments. As increased volatility and constraints on global capital flows have affected foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to India in the past few years, the country is focusing on deregulation to boost growth and attract investment by fostering a more business-friendly environment.
This involves streamlining regulatory requirements and simplifying administrative processes to improve the ease of doing business. The government also announced an increase in capital expenditure in the union budget for FY26 by earmarking around INR11.2 trillion (USD134.5 billion), emphasising its commitment to infrastructure-driven growth. The report further highlights key government initiatives, including the National Single Window System and BharatTradeNet, to streamline business approvals and payments. It also mentions policies such as the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund and the National Manufacturing Mission to attract private and institutional investments, create a dynamic micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector and a future-ready workforce for in-demand jobs.
India’s strong economic performance presents an opportunity for the country to implement essential structural reforms to realise the ambition of becoming an advanced economy by 2047.

India has displayed steady and robust economic growth while facing global challenges and geopolitical concerns and it continues to maintain its position as the fastest-growing major economy. India is estimated to clock in a GDP growth of 6.2 and 6.3 per cent in FY25 and FY26, respectively, backed by strong domestic demand, substantial infrastructure development initiatives, a spike in rural demand and effective government policy measures.
The report underscores a sustained drop in inflation in recent months, shrinking fiscal deficit due to an increase in tax revenue and growth in exports year on year in FY25, highlighting a robust macroeconomic foundation for India. These trends also play a key role in reinforcing economic stability and investor confidence. The manufacturing sector continues to expand sharply despite experiencing a slowdown for over a year, driven by significant domestic and global demand.
Major government initiatives such as Make in India and the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme further boost domestic production and enhance India’s competitiveness. Over the past two decades, India has consistently contributed a sizable share to global activity and growth. The nation continues to cement its position as a sought-after hub for innovation and entrepreneurship with its rapidly expanding startup ecosystem and its status as the world’s third most preferred destination for technology investments. As increased volatility and constraints on global capital flows have affected foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to India in the past few years, the country is focusing on deregulation to boost growth and attract investment by fostering a more business-friendly environment.
This involves streamlining regulatory requirements and simplifying administrative processes to improve the ease of doing business. The government also announced an increase in capital expenditure in the union budget for FY26 by earmarking around INR11.2 trillion (USD134.5 billion), emphasising its commitment to infrastructure-driven growth. The report further highlights key government initiatives, including the National Single Window System and BharatTradeNet, to streamline business approvals and payments. It also mentions policies such as the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund and the National Manufacturing Mission to attract private and institutional investments, create a dynamic micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector and a future-ready workforce for in-demand jobs.
India’s strong economic performance presents an opportunity for the country to implement essential structural reforms to realise the ambition of becoming an advanced economy by 2047.

India’s digital revolution is reaching new heights. As the country accelerates towards a digitally empowered future, satellite communications (SatCom) is emerging as a critical enabler to bridge the digital divide, especially in remote and underserved regions. From powering high-speed internet to enabling smart agriculture in rural areas, SatCom is poised to complement terrestrial networks and expand the reach while contributing to India’s digital transformation. With the government’s push for inclusive connectivity, recent policy shifts, and the entry of global and domestic players into India’s satellite broadband space, the stage is set for SatCom to become the next big leap in India’s connectivity journey.
What is now leading this paradigm shift from vision to execution are the many structural enablers that have come into action in the last few years. To begin with, there is an increasing willingness by the government to liberalise the space sector, allowing private players to collaborate more closely with organisations like ISRO and IN-SPACe. KPMG International’s 2024 TMT Outlook also revealed that India has already emerged as the 5thlargest global ecosystem in terms of private space-tech investments. With over 119 homegrown startups raising approximately USD 2 billion in cumulative funding - this rapid growth is reshaping the satellite broadband narrative— and is moving the needle – from being perceived as a niche backhaul solution to now being seen as a mainstream digital infrastructure pillar.
The commercialisation of space is also supported by critical technological tailwinds emerging now. Small satellite constellations (LEO clusters), reusable launch vehicles, 3D-printed satellite components, and software-defined payloads are helping to reduce the costs dramatically and are accelerating go-to-market timelines. Coupled with falling per-bit data prices along with improved satellite connectivity throughput capacity, these advancements are making SatCom more accessible—not only for companies and enterprise use cases but also for individual consumption at the community level - in areas where fibre deployment remains economically unviable. However, for the individuals to use SatComs, it’s important to make hardware more accessible and available at subsidised prices and plans.
Policy formulation has also been equally powerful. Initiatives such as the National Broadband Mission and BharatNet are already creating the scaffolding & space for digital inclusion. The Draft Indian Space Policy 2023 and proposed Satellite Communication Policy further reflect the government’s intent to offer clarity on licensing, spectrum allocation, and landing rights—elements that historically lacked predictability. When seen in conjunction with the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes in telecom hardware and the push for 5G connectivity across urban and rural India, a convergence is clearly underway: SatCom stands today as more than a standalone technology – more like an essential cog in India’s integrated digital architecture and a strong enabler to connect the unconnected India.
However, the path ahead is not without friction. While the regulatory environment is evolving, the absence of a unified and enforceable space communications framework continues to create grey zones for investors and operators alike. Fragmented policies, lack of clarity on auction versus administrative allocation of spectrum, and limited guidelines around orbital slot access are impeding the ability of private players to commit long-term capital at scale. The industry today needs a forward-looking, single-window regulatory approach that addresses both legacy bottlenecks and emerging realities.
India’s satellite communication market is projected to grow rapidly, driven by connectivity demands in remote areas and the evolution of space tech. However, regulatory bottlenecks—particularly uncertainty around spectrum allocation and delays in ITU coordination—continue to slow deployment. Meanwhile, infrastructure gaps remain a hurdle. Despite promising progress, India needs stronger ground station networks and deeper fiber backhaul to fully integrate satellite services with terrestrial connectivity. Unlocking the full potential of SatCom will require clear policy signals, public-private partnerships, and investment-friendly reforms to support the next phase of India’s digital inclusion push.
Another key challenge that continues to be prominent is the relevance of cost dynamics. Even though the cost of manufacturing in the satellite launch around orbits, the overall capex and opex involved in building out a viable SatCom business model—especially in low-ARPU markets—remains high. We must focus on ensuring affordability for both end-users and for device accessibility, through efforts such as financial incentives, universal service obligations, and low-cost terminal equipment and innovation. Furthermore, as SatCom traffic scales up, there will also be increasing red flags around cybersecurity, data integrity, and interoperability—which invites more attention on robust security protocols & international collaboration.
As India charts its course toward becoming a digitally inclusive economy, satellite communications, creates an avenue to launch the next phase for the sector. From enabling high-speed internet access in remote villages to enhancing national disaster response, SatCom can be envisioned to complement terrestrial infrastructure and empower the powerful vision of Digital India.
In the age of AI, satellite technology also holds the potential to compliment hyper-intelligent, self-optimising networks that deliver personalisation and scalability in a way that has never been done before. But to fully unlock the power of the industry, including ‘last-mile-first’ connectivity in India’s digital revolution, there is an increasing dependence on creating an ecosystem that encourages responsible and scalable AI adoption. KPMG in India’s 2024 report Redefining TMT with AI highlights that element such as that talent readiness, infrastructure investment, and ethical frameworks are just as vital as the technology itself. With 33% of organisations projecting that up to half their workforce will be AI-ready by FY26, and over 65% of Indian CXOs endorsing generative AI as a competitive advantage, there’s clear potential of moving rapidly towards creating a future-proof foundation.
Having said all of this, it is clear that the future of SatCom in India is undeniably promising. What is required now is a deliberate and collaborative approach—which is anchored in meaningful policy, agile regulation, and collaborative efforts through industry-government-academia partnerships. The real opportunity lies not only in connecting individuals but in empowering them to participate purposefully in the digital economy—whether through telehealth consultations in the Northeast, e-learning in Ladakh, or real-time weather intelligence for farmers in drought-prone regions.
India’s space and digital narratives are no longer parallel—they are converging. With the right enablers, SatCom can be the backbone of a truly inclusive and powerful digital Bharat – a version of India where digital public infrastructure and private innovation work in together to ensure that no citizen is left behind. The leap from sky to screen is already underway. The actual onus now lies in sustaining this momentum with purpose, practicality and with a vision of the bigger picture.

U.S. tariffs have left supply chain experts scrambling for answers. Strategies are being rewritten in real-time to navigate a terrain that’s only getting tougher.
The ripple effects are everywhere—from manufacturers and shipping agents to dockworkers, retailers and consumers. Every part of a well-oiled supply chain is under strain. Considering this, estimates suggest that global containers volumes could drop by 1 per cent this year, signalling rough seas ahead for trade.1
In 2024, global logistics costs hit USD12.38 trillion—up by USD330 billion over the previous year.2With fresh tariff shockwaves, these costs are expected to climb even higher—prompting logistics players to rethink operations and build resilience at every link of the chain.
While the logistics network is shifting, what are some emerging opportunities for India to tap into?
Shipping rates are expected to spike up, forcing companies to absorb higher freight bills or pass them on to consumers, resulting in an intense cost pressure building up.
While freight rates are spiking, high demand on diverted trade routes like India–U.S. can give Indian logistics providers better control over prices and margins.
To avoid tariffs, global companies are shifting manufacturing to new regions. This trend is reshaping freight routes and forcing local logistics networks to adapt fast.
India’s relatively better tariff position is making it a viable alternative. This can be an opportunity for India’s logistics players to build stronger regional and cross-border networks.
3PL players are under pressure to help businesses navigate evolving custom rules, reroute shipments and cut through red tape.
Indian freight forwarders and 3PL players can step up as strategic partners, offering key solutions, such as compliance, cost optimisation and flexible routing alternatives.
Tariff evasion tactics like false classification of goods or illegal routing are becoming more common. Logistics providers need stronger checks to safeguard operations and reputation.
While risky tactics are in play, India needs to be careful considering the shuffling trade flows. By strengthening compliance systems and enhancing digitisation of trade processes, India can position itself as a transparent trade partner.
Logistics today is about moving smarter, faster and staying strategically aligned in a world shaped by dynamic policy changes. For India, it’s a chance to step up and play a bigger role in the next wave of global trade.
[1]U.S. tariffs may cause 1 per cent decline in global container port volume, World Ports Org., 25 April 2025, accessed on 30 April 2025[2]Global logistics costs to grow by 12 per cent and hit USD14.4 trillion by 2029, 13 November 2024, accessed on 30 April 2025

The ripple effects are everywhere—from manufacturers and shipping agents to dockworkers, retailers and consumers. Every part of a well-oiled supply chain is under strain. Considering this, estimates suggest that global containers volumes could drop by 1 per cent this year, signalling rough seas ahead for trade.1
In 2024, global logistics costs hit USD12.38 trillion—up by USD330 billion over the previous year.2With fresh tariff shockwaves, these costs are expected to climb even higher—prompting logistics players to rethink operations and build resilience at every link of the chain.
While the logistics network is shifting, what are some emerging opportunities for India to tap into?
Shipping rates are expected to spike up, forcing companies to absorb higher freight bills or pass them on to consumers, resulting in an intense cost pressure building up.
While freight rates are spiking, high demand on diverted trade routes like India–U.S. can give Indian logistics providers better control over prices and margins.
To avoid tariffs, global companies are shifting manufacturing to new regions. This trend is reshaping freight routes and forcing local logistics networks to adapt fast.
India’s relatively better tariff position is making it a viable alternative. This can be an opportunity for India’s logistics players to build stronger regional and cross-border networks.
3PL players are under pressure to help businesses navigate evolving custom rules, reroute shipments and cut through red tape.
Indian freight forwarders and 3PL players can step up as strategic partners, offering key solutions, such as compliance, cost optimisation and flexible routing alternatives.
Tariff evasion tactics like false classification of goods or illegal routing are becoming more common. Logistics providers need stronger checks to safeguard operations and reputation.
While risky tactics are in play, India needs to be careful considering the shuffling trade flows. By strengthening compliance systems and enhancing digitisation of trade processes, India can position itself as a transparent trade partner.
Logistics today is about moving smarter, faster and staying strategically aligned in a world shaped by dynamic policy changes. For India, it’s a chance to step up and play a bigger role in the next wave of global trade.

In recent weeks, global trade has become even more complex as shifting tariff policies continue to fuel uncertainty across international markets and disrupt supply chains again. So, what are some risks, opportunities and strategies lying ahead for India?
In a fragmented geopolitical and trade landscape, aligning too closely with one bloc can put India at risk. Considering that global value chains are deeply interlinked, we need to be strategically diplomatic without compromising on long-term economic goals.
Maintain trade neutrality, strengthen domestic manufacturing and deepen ties with emerging markets.
As China looks for alternative selling markets, India can face a wave of cheap imports. With our trade deficit with China already at a record high of USD99.2 billion, we need to be more watchful.1
Engage in strategic dialogue to lower tariff and non-tariff barriers, unlocking better access for our exporters. At the same time, strengthen local value chains for critical inputs to boost manufacturing resilience.
India has imposed a 12 per cent safeguard duty on select steel imports to protect domestic manufacturers.2We need to be more proactive in monitoring developments and implementing strategies.
Stay vigilant and implement essential trade measures to shield domestic industries from dumping threats.
With the U.S. tariffs pushing firms to rethink sourcing, India has a chance to capitalise—but only if we focus on strategic value chain integration. To meet the non-preferential rules of origin criteria, we need to prioritise ‘substantial transformation’ over ‘basic assembly’.
Focus on developing deep manufacturing capabilities and prioritise strengthening the technology ecosystem.
India will potentially be the first country to sign a trade pact with the U.S., giving us a head start in the supply chain realignment race. Currently, India’s bilateral trade with the U.S. stands at around USD120 billion.3The agreement can take this up to USD500 billion by 2030.4Besides, we also need to diversify our export markets with other key countries.
Reduce single market dependency by fast-tracking FTAs with countries, such as the U.K., EU, Oman and Canada, where Indian exporters can capitalise on emerging market opportunities.
India’s position in global trade is rising but staying ahead will require sharp strategy and stronger alignment with global shifts. By leveraging its growing global position, the country can play a larger role in the evolving supply chain landscape.

Empowering human-AI collaboration for a trusted future
Share
AI has the immense potential to transform lives, boost industries and help tackle some of the most pressing global issues. Fully realising this potential requires collaboration, a collective commitment to responsible innovation and appropriate regulation with education programs and skills development initiatives to help individuals better harness AI’s power.
Led by the University of Melbourne in collaboration with KPMG,Trust, attitudes and use of Artificial Intelligence: A global study 2025opens in a new tab, surveyed more than 48,000 people across 47 countries to explore the impact AI is having on individuals and organisations. It is one of the most wide-ranging global studies into the public’s trust, use, and attitudes towards AI to date.
The findings reveal that AI adoption is on the rise, but trust remains a critical challenge - reflecting a tension between the benefits and risks:
66% of people use AI regularly, and83% believe the use of AI will result in a wide range of benefits.
Yet, trust remains a critical challenge: only46% of people globally are willing to trust AI systems.
There is a public mandate for national and international AI regulation with70% believing regulation is needed.
Manyrely on AI output without evaluating accuracy(66%) and are making mistakes in their work due to AI (56%).

Empowering human-AI collaboration for a trusted future
This research, along with our perspective on the findings, offers a data-driven view of where leadership focus, strategic investment and workforce enablement are most urgently needed and how rising public expectations for strong AI regulation and governance need to be addressed.
For organisations to realise the true potential of AI and achieve a competitive advantage, there are four key actions that leaders should prioritise:
By acting decisively to address these areas, organisations can not only mitigate current risks but also drive sustainable innovation and growth.
Alongside the study, we’ve developed our perspective on the global study’s finding -The age of Intelligence – Empowering human-AI collaboration for a trusted futureopens in a new tabexplores the implications for organisations and highlights how they can leverage these insights to harness the transformative power of AI.

Executive summary
The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 brought the transformative power 
of AI firmly into the public consciousness and everyday experience. 
While exponential investment in AI predated its release, individual and 
organizational use of AI has increased dramatically and rapidly since 2022.1 
For example, OpenAI’s suite of generative AI tools obtained over 100 million 
users in only two months.2 AI is now firmly part of everyday life and work 
for many people and is widely embraced across all sectors of the global 
economy, including finance, education, transport, manufacturing, agriculture, 
healthcare, retail, and media.3 
The benefits and promise of AI for society and 
business are undeniable. AI systems are being 
used to make cancer detection faster and more 
accurate, enhance the efficiency of renewable 
energies, and drive productivity and innovation 
in the workplace, among other impactful use 
cases.4 However, as AI’s capabilities and reach 
become more apparent, so too has awareness 
of the risks and challenges, raising questions 
about the trustworthiness, regulation, and 
governance of AI systems. The public’s trust in AI 
technologies and its responsible and ethical use 
is central to sustained acceptance and adoption 
and in realizing the full societal and economic 
benefits of these technologies.
Given the rapid advancement and widespread 
adoption of AI technologies—and their 
transformative effects on society, work, education, 
and the economy—bringing the public voice into 
the conversation has never been more critical. 
This research aims to provide an evidence-based 
understanding of people’s trust, use and attitudes 
toward AI, their views on the impacts of AI, and 
expectations of its governance and regulation. 
The insights are important to inform public policy 
and industry practice and a human-centered 
approach to stewarding AI into work and society. 
They can help policymakers, organizational leaders, 
and those involved in developing, deploying, and 
governing AI systems to understand and align 
with evolving public expectations, and deepen 
understanding of the opportunities and challenges 
of AI integration. 
The report provides timely, global research 
insights on a range of questions, including the 
extent to which people trust, use, and understand 
AI systems; how they perceive and experience 
the benefits, risks and impacts of AI use in 
society, at work and in education; expectations 
for the management, governance and regulation 
of AI by organizations and governments; how 
employees and students are using AI for work 
and study; and perceived support for the 
responsible use of AI. It draws out commonalities 
and differences in these key dimensions across 
countries and sub-groups of the population, and 
sheds light on how trust and attitudes toward AI 
have changed over the past two years since the 
widespread uptake of generative AI. 
Next, we summarize the key research insights.
Now in its fourth iteration, the research captures 
the views of more than 48,000 people from 
47 countries, representing all global geographic 
regions. It offers the most comprehensive 
examination to date of public trust and attitudes 
toward AI. In addition, it takes a deep dive into 
how employees and students use AI in work 
and education and their experience of the 
impacts of AI in these specific settings.

A snapshot of key findings
Trust and acceptance of AI
Trust in AI systems remains a significant 
challenge: over half (54%) are wary about 
trusting AI. People are more skeptical of 
the safety, security and societal impact of 
AI and more trusting of its technical ability. 
While most people feel both optimistic 
and worried about AI, 72% accept its use. 
People in advanced economies are less 
trusting (39% vs. 57%) and accepting (65% 
vs. 84%) compared to emerging economies.
AI use and understanding
Two in three (66%) intentionally use AI on a 
regular basis and three in five say they can 
use AI effectively. However, most (61%) 
have no AI training and half report limited 
knowledge. People in emerging economies 
report higher regular use (80% vs 58%), 
training (50% vs 32%), knowledge (64% vs 
46%) and efficacy (74% vs 51%) than those 
in advanced economies. People that are 
younger, university-educated, higher-income 
earners and AI-trained report more trust, 
use and AI literacy. 
AI benefits and risks 
People report experiencing both benefits 
and negative outcomes from AI use. 
While many report improved efficiency, 
accessibility, decision-making and innovation, 
concerns about cybersecurity, privacy and IP, 
misinformation, loss of human connection, 
job loss and deskilling are widespread. The 
public's ambivalence towards AI is evident, 
with divided opinion on whether the benefits 
outweigh the risks in advanced economies.
AI regulation and governance 
There is a strong public mandate for AI 
regulation, with 70% believing regulation is 
necessary. However, only 43% believe current 
laws are adequate. People expect international 
laws (76%), national government regulation 
(69%), and co-regulation with industry (71%). 
87% also want laws and fact-checking to 
combat AI-generated misinformation.
AI adoption in the workplace 
Three in five (58%) employees intentionally 
use AI at work on a regular basis, with a 
third using it weekly. Generative AI tools are 
most commonly used with many employees 
opting for free, publicly available tools rather 
than employer-provided options. Emerging 
economies are leading in employee adoption 
with 72% using AI regularly compared to 
49% in advanced economies.
Impacts of AI at work
Over half of employees report performance 
benefits from AI. However, employees also 
report mixed impacts on workload, human 
interaction and compliance and two in five 
believe AI will replace jobs in their area. Many 
employees report inappropriate, complacent 
and non-transparent use of AI in their work, 
contravening policies and resulting in errors 
and dependency. Governance and training 
to support responsible AI use appears to 
be lagging adoption.
Student engagement with AI 
Four in five students (83%, predominately 
tertiary) regularly use AI in their studies, 
reporting benefits such as efficiency, 
personalization of learning, and reduced 
workload and stress. However, inappropriate, 
complacent and non-transparent use of AI by 
students is widespread, raising concerns about 
over-reliance and diminished critical thinking, 
collaboration, and equity of assessment. 
Only half report their education provider has 
policies, resources or training to support 
responsible AI use.

The age of working with AI is here and is 
delivering performance benefits, but also 
mixed impacts
Across countries, almost three in five employees 
intentionally5 use AI at work on a regular basis, 
with almost a third using it weekly or more. 
General-purpose generative AI tools are by far 
the most widely used, with most employees 
using free, public tools like ChatGPT rather than 
tools provided by their employer. Three in four 
report that their organization uses AI, with almost 
half stating AI is used in a broad range of tasks 
and functions. 
Emerging economies6 are leading workplace 
adoption of AI, with employees in these economies 
more likely to use AI regularly (72% vs 49%) than 
those in advanced economies. 
The use of AI at work is clearly delivering a range 
of positive performance benefits. Most employees 
report increased work efficiency, access to accurate 
information, innovation, higher quality of work and 
decisions, and better use and development of 
skills and abilities. Almost half report that AI use 
has increased revenue-generating activity. 
However, employees also report mixed impacts 
on workload, stress, human collaboration, 
compliance, and surveillance at work. For example, 
half say they use AI rather than collaborating with 
peers or supervisors to get work done, and one 
in five say AI use has reduced communication, 
interaction and collaboration, raising the question 
of how human connectivity will be retained in AI-
augmented workplaces. These insights underscore 
the importance of understanding and managing 
the impacts of AI at work, ensuring appropriate 
work design, and building employee capabilities 
in effective human-AI collaboration. 
The responsible use and governance of 
AI is not keeping pace with adoption: 
many employees are using AI in 
complacent and inappropriate ways 
which increase risk
While the rapid adoption of AI is delivering 
benefits, many employees are using AI in 
complacent and inappropriate ways, increasing 
risks for organizations and individuals and raising 
quality issues. For example, almost half admit to 
using AI in ways that contravene organizational 
policies and uploading sensitive company 
information, such as financial, sales, or customer 
information, to public AI tools. Three in five report 
they have seen or heard of other employees 
using AI tools in inappropriate ways. Two in three 
report relying on AI output without evaluating the 
information it provides, and over half say they 
have made mistakes in their work due to AI.
What makes these risks even more challenging 
to manage is that over half of employees avoid 
revealing when they use AI to complete their work 
and present AI-generated content as their own. 
These findings highlight a lack of transparency and 
accountability in the way AI, particularly generative 
AI tools, are being used by employees at work. 
This complacent use may be fueled by inadequate 
training, guidance, and governance of responsible 
AI use at work: within organizations that use 
AI, only one in two employees in advanced 
economies report that their organization offers 
training in responsible AI, has policies and 
practices on responsible AI use, or a strategy and 
culture that supports AI. Despite the high use of 
generative AI tools, only two in five say there is a 
policy guiding its use. Complacent use may also 
be exacerbated by a sense of pressure to use AI, 
with half of employees feeling they will be left 
behind if they don’t.
From a governance perspective, these findings 
highlight a critical gap and urgent need for 
organizations to proactively invest in responsible 
AI training and the AI literacy of employees 
to promote critical engagement with AI tools. 
They also underscore the need to put in place 
mechanisms to effectively guide and govern how 
employees use AI tools in their everyday work, 
to promote greater accountability, transparency, 
and employee engagement.

Most students use AI and report benefits, 
but inappropriate use and over-reliance 
is widespread and challenging critical 
skill development 
The findings for students (predominately tertiary 
students) provide insight into how AI is being 
used by the next generation of the workforce and 
affecting education and training. Results mirror 
those for employees but are more pronounced. 
Four in five (83%) students regularly use AI in 
their studies, with half using it weekly or daily. 
The large majority use free, publicly available 
generative AI tools. 
Most students are deriving significant benefits 
from AI use in education, such as increased 
efficiency, access to information, quality of work, 
idea generation and personalization of learning, 
and reduced workload and stress. However, AI’s 
influence on social dynamics, critical thinking, 
and assessment is mixed. For example, a quarter 
to a third of students report reduced critical 
thinking and less communication, interaction, 
and collaboration with instructors and peers. 
A similar number perceive less trust of students 
by instructors and peers, and reduced fairness 
and equity of assessment due to AI.
The complacent use of AI by students is 
widespread. Most students have used AI 
inappropriately, contravening rules and guidelines 
and over-relying on AI. Two-thirds have not 
been transparent in their AI use, presenting 
AI-generated content as their own and hiding 
their use of AI tools. Only half regularly engage 
critically with AI tools and their output. 
The level of student dependence on AI is 
concerning: over three-quarters have felt they 
could not complete their work without the 
help of AI and rely on it to do tasks rather than 
learning how themselves. Four in five say they 
put less effort into their studies and assessment 
knowing they can rely on AI. 
A lack of institutional support for responsible AI 
use may be contributing to this problem: only half 
of students report their education provider has 
policies to guide responsible use of AI in learning 
and assessment, or training and resources to 
support AI understanding and responsible use.
These findings may have longer-term implications 
for the effective development of essential skills—
such as critical thinking, communication and 
collaboration, with implications for organizations 
as these students enter the workforce. 
Trust in AI cannot be taken for granted: 
many people are wary about trusting 
AI systems, particularly in advanced 
economies
Despite high rates of individual adoption, trust 
remains a critical challenge. Over half (54%) 
of people are wary about trusting AI systems. 
Underlying this average are differences between 
economic groups: three in five people in 
advanced economies are unwilling or unsure 
about trusting AI systems. In contrast, in 
emerging economies, three in five people trust 
AI systems. We find similar levels for employee 
trust in the use of AI at work, and student trust 
of AI for educational purposes.
People are more skeptical about the safety, 
security, and ethical use of AI systems and more 
trusting of the technical ability of AI to provide 
helpful output and services. This helps explain 
individual use of AI to gain performance benefits, 
despite trust concerns around its broader impact 
on society and people. While the majority accept 
the use of AI systems, most people report low 
or moderate acceptance and approval levels. 
People’s ambivalence toward AI is also reflected 
in their emotions: the majority report optimism 
and excitement, coupled with worry. 
People have high confidence in universities, 
research, and healthcare institutions to use and 
develop AI in the best interests of the public, 
and generally less confidence in government 
to do so. People in advanced economies have 
lower confidence in industry and big technology 
companies to develop and use AI in the public 
interest, whereas confidence in these entities 
is high in emerging economies.
Organizations can build stakeholders’ trust in 
their use of AI by investing in responsible AI 
governance mechanisms that signal trustworthy 
use: four in five people report they would 
be more willing to trust an AI system when 
assurance mechanisms are in place, such as 
monitoring system reliability, human oversight and 
accountability, responsible AI policies and training, 
adhering to international AI standards, and 
independent third-party AI assurance systems.

People are experiencing a range of 
benefits and negative outcomes from 
the use of AI in society 
People’s ambivalence toward AI stems from the 
mixed benefits, risks and negative impacts that 
are being felt from AI use in society: 42 percent 
believe the benefits outweigh the risks, 32 percent 
believe the risks outweigh the benefits, and 
26 percent believe the benefits and risks 
are balanced.
Three in four report experiencing a broad 
range of benefits, including improved efficiency 
and effectiveness, enhanced accessibility to 
information and services, greater precision and 
personalization, improved decision-making and 
outcomes, greater innovation and creativity, 
reduced costs and better use of resources. 
These outcomes benefit individuals, while 
also bringing performance-oriented benefits 
to organizations and society more broadly. 
However, people’s experience of these benefits 
is coupled with clear concerns about the risks 
and negative impacts of AI on society. Four in 
five people are concerned about—and two in 
five have personally experienced or observed—
negative outcomes from AI. These include 
the loss of human interaction and connection, 
cybersecurity risks, loss of privacy or intellectual 
property, misinformation and manipulation, 
harmful or inaccurate outcomes, deskilling and 
dependency, job loss, and disadvantage from 
unequal access to AI. Comparatively fewer 
people are concerned about AI bias resulting in 
unfair treatment and the environmental impact of 
AI, however even these outcomes are reported 
by a third of people surveyed. 
Respondents across countries share similar 
views and experiences regarding AI risks and 
negative outcomes, highlighting these as areas 
of universal concern. These negative outcomes 
are not just ‘perceived risks’ but harms that are 
being experienced or observed by a significant 
proportion of people across the 47 countries 
surveyed. These findings reinforce the need for 
international cooperation and coordinated action 
to prevent and mitigate AI risks and negative 
impacts. The challenge is doing this in a balanced 
way that does not undermine progress or hinder 
the innovation required to realize the many 
societal benefits of AI. 
The public expect AI regulation at both 
the national and international level. 
Yet the current regulatory landscape 
is falling short of public expectations.
There is a strong public mandate for AI regulation 
to mitigate the societal risks and negative 
impacts of AI: Seventy percent of people believe 
AI regulation is required, including the majority 
in almost all countries surveyed. This broad 
public consensus on the need for regulation 
supports national and international efforts in many 
jurisdictions to develop and implement regulatory 
and governance frameworks to support the safe 
and responsible use of AI.
However, the current regulatory landscape is 
falling short of public expectations: only two in 
five believe that the existing laws and regulation 
governing AI systems in their country are 
adequate. Most people are unaware of laws, 
legislation or government policy that apply to AI. 
These findings reflect that most countries 
and jurisdictions are still in an early stage 
of designing or implementing regulatory 
approaches. While some countries have adaptive 
legislation that may apply to AI (e.g. consumer 
or privacy laws), such laws are absent or weakly 
enforced in some jurisdictions. This suggests 
the need to clarify, develop or strengthen such 
legislation where it is lacking and to educate 
and raise public awareness of applicable laws. 
The importance of effective, fit-for-purpose 
regulation—and awareness of such regulation—
is underscored by our finding that the perceived 
adequacy of AI regulation is a key predictor of 
trust and acceptance of AI systems.
The majority of people expect a multipronged 
national and international regulatory approach 
to AI, with international laws and regulation the 
most endorsed form of regulation and supported 
by a clear majority in all countries. National 
government regulation or a co-regulatory 
approach between government and industry is 
preferred in most countries over self-regulation 
by industry or an independent AI regulator. 
This highlights the public’s expectation that 
government takes a central role in ensuring 
effective governance and regulation of AI, as 
well as the expectation that industry will work 
with regulatory bodies and proactively align 
their governance approach with the evolving 
regulatory landscape.

There is also a clear mandate for stronger 
regulation of AI-generated misinformation: 
87 percent of respondents want laws to combat 
AI-generated misinformation and expect social 
media and media companies to implement 
stronger fact-checking processes and methods 
that enable people to detect AI-generated 
content. Our findings indicate that AI generated 
misinformation is a key concern globally and is 
undermining trust in online content and raising 
concerns about the integrity of elections. 
AI literacy is lagging AI adoption yet is 
critical for responsible and effective use
Although AI tools are being widely used by the 
public, employees and students, AI literacy 
remains limited; about half of respondents say 
they don’t feel they understand AI nor when or 
how it is used. Half of respondents are unaware 
that AI underpins common applications such as 
social media, despite 90 percent saying they 
use such platforms. This knowledge gap reflects 
that only two in five people report any AI-related 
training or education.
Despite low rates of knowledge and training, 
three in five say they can use AI effectively. 
This likely reflects the easily accessible 
interfaces of many AI systems (e.g. using 
natural language) and low barriers to use. 
While this accessibility has benefits, it also 
risks fostering complacency and overreliance 
if not accompanied by meaningful levels of 
understanding and literacy.
AI literacy is higher in emerging economies, 
where three-quarters believe they can use 
AI effectively, compared to half in advanced 
economies, and half report AI training or education 
compared to a third in advanced economies. 
AI literacy consistently emerges in our findings 
as a cross-cutting enabler: it is associated with 
greater use, trust, acceptance, and critical 
engagement, and more realized benefits from 
AI use including more performance benefits in 
the workplace. 
The pattern of findings underscores that AI 
literacy and training in responsible use is not only 
a personal skillset, but can also be a strategic 
capability for organizations and societies alike, 
enabling people to recognize and seize the 
capabilities of AI while recognizing their limitations 
and guarding against harm. Investing in AI literacy 
is a critical component of ensuring AI is used 
safely, ethically, and to its full potential.
There are notable differences between 
countries with advanced and emerging 
economies: People in emerging 
economies report greater trust, 
acceptance and adoption of AI, higher 
levels of AI literacy, and more realized 
benefits from AI
One of the most striking insights from the survey 
is the stark contrast in use, trust, and attitudes 
toward AI between people in advanced and 
emerging economies. 
People in emerging economies report higher 
adoption and use of AI both at work and for 
personal purposes, are more trusting and 
accepting of AI, and feel more positive about 
its use. They report higher levels of AI training 
and literacy, are more likely to expect and 
realize the benefits of AI, and view AI benefits 
as outweighing the risks. They are also more 
confident in the development and use of AI by 
commercial organizations and big technology 
companies and more likely to view current 
AI regulation and safeguards as adequate, 
compared to people in advanced economies. 
These differences hold even when controlling 
for the effects of age and education. 
These findings suggest that many countries 
with emerging economies are leading the 
way in terms of AI adoption.7 In particular, six 
countries with emerging economies strongly 
and consistently show this pattern—India, China, 
Nigeria, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Of the 
advanced economies, Norway, Israel, Singapore, 
Switzerland and Latvia have comparatively high 
levels of AI adoption, trust, acceptance, and 
positive attitudes toward AI.

An implication is that these countries may 
be uniquely positioned to rapidly accelerate 
innovation and technological advantage through 
AI. This has implications for global competitive 
dynamics and may create shifts in the economic 
landscape across countries in the future as AI 
becomes a more prominent driver of productivity 
and economic activity. 
Pathways to support the trusted and 
responsible adoption of AI 
Our modeling supports four distinct yet 
complementary pathways to trusted and 
sustained AI adoption: a knowledge pathway 
reflecting the importance of supporting people’s 
AI literacy and efficacy through AI training and 
education; a motivational pathway reflecting 
the importance of deploying AI in a human-
centric way that delivers benefits to people; 
the uncertainty reduction pathway reflecting 
the need to address concerns about the risks 
associated with AI, and an institutional pathway 
reflecting the adequacy of current safeguards, 
regulation and laws to promote safe AI use, 
and confidence in entities to develop and use 
AI in the public interest. 
Of these drivers, the institutional pathway 
had the strongest influence on trust, followed 
by the motivational pathway. This model also 
holds at the organizational level where the 
institutional pathway reflects appropriate levels 
of organizational governance, strategy, and 
training to support AI and its responsible use.
AI adoption has increased markedly 
since 2022, but trust in AI has declined 
and worry has increased
Our research program provided the unique 
opportunity to compare data from the current 
survey with our previous survey data collected from 
17 countries in late 2022, just prior to the release 
of ChatGPT. This comparison revealed a trend 
of less positive attitudes toward AI, as adoption 
has increased.
As expected, adoption of AI in the workplace 
increased dramatically in all 17 countries: employee 
reported organizational use of AI increased from 
34 percent to 71 percent, and employees’ use of AI 
at work increased from 54 percent to 67 percent. 
The largest increases occurred in Australia, 
Canada, the USA, and the UK. 
However, this increased adoption is coupled with a 
trend toward people feeling more concerned about 
and less trusting of AI. People’s perceptions of the 
trustworthiness of AI systems and their willingness 
to rely on AI declined in most countries, as did 
employee trust of AI at work in some countries. 
This decline in trust likely reflects that increased 
use and exposure, particularly to general-purpose 
generative AI tools, has increased awareness of 
both the capabilities and benefits of these tools, 
and also their limitations and potential negative 
impacts (e.g. hallucinations), prompting more 
considered trust and reliance. 
More people report feeling worried about AI 
and concerned about the risks, and fewer view 
the benefits of AI as outweighing the risks. For 
example, in Brazil half of people reported feeling 
worried about AI in 2022 compared to 75% in 
2024, and the view that the benefits of AI outweigh 
the risks fell from 71% to 44%. Excitement also 
dampened over this time in several countries. 
With this increase in concern, the importance of 
organizational assurance mechanisms as a basis 
for trust increased in all countries, suggesting 
a greater need for reassurance that AI is being 
used in a trustworthy and responsible way. 
Attitudes toward the regulation of AI remained 
stable and there was no overall change to the 
perceived adequacy of regulation and laws.
Despite the rapid uptake of AI, we found no 
discernible change in the public’s self-reported 
understanding of AI, or their objective awareness 
of AI use in common applications. 
This pattern of findings suggests that the hype 
of AI may be giving way to a more realistic and 
measured assessment of AI’s capabilities and 
limitations, benefits and risks, and heightened need 
for reassurance around the trustworthy deployment 
of AI and proactive mitigation of AI risks.
Collectively, the survey insights provide 
evidence-based pathways for strengthening the 
responsible use of AI systems and the trusted 
adoption of AI in society and work. These 
insights are relevant for informing responsible 
AI strategy, practice and policy within business, 
government, and education at a national level, 
as well as informing AI guidelines, policy 
and regulation at the international and pan-
governmental level.

This is the fourth survey in our program of 
research examining public trust and attitudes 
toward AI. Our current report examines the 
perspectives of over 48,000 people from 
47 countries covering all global geographic 
regions, using nationally representative 
sampling of the adult population based on 
age, gender, and regional distribution. Taking 
a global perspective is crucial, given that AI 
systems are not bound by physical borders 
and are rapidly being deployed and used 
across the world. 
Our program of research provided the unique 
opportunity to benchmark and compare the 
findings in this report to our previous survey 
data collected from 17 countries in late 2022, 
just prior to the release of ChatGPT. We 
examine changes in public trust and attitudes 
over time in these 17 countries and highlight 
changes where relevant throughout the report 
(see ‘How we conducted the research’ for 
more details). 
Introduction
The motivation for this research is to provide an evidence-based understanding 
of public trust, attitudes, and experiences of AI, and expectations of its 
governance and regulation, as a resource to inform public policy and industry 
and government practice. 
Given the rapid advancement, widespread deployment and transformative 
impact of AI technologies, it is important to regularly examine public trust, 
attitudes, and expectations of AI. Equally important is documenting how 
people use AI technologies and experience the impacts of AI in their lives, 
work, and studies, and the implications this may have for organizations, 
education providers, and society at large. To date, there has been limited 
empirical insight addressing these critical issues, underscoring the relevance 
of this research in promoting human-centered AI that meets evolving 
societal needs and expectations. 
The Trust in AI 
Research Program
This study is the fourth in a research 
program examining public trust in 
AI. Each study has been designed 
to uphold academic rigor and 
independence, whilst leveraging the 
deep multidisciplinary expertise and 
insight from KPMG. The first focused 
on Australians’ trust in AI in 2020, the 
second expanded the research scope 
to study trust in five countries in 2021, 
and the third surveyed people in 
17 countries in 2022.

Our research insights are structured in three 
sections. The first focuses on AI use broadly in 
society examining the public’s use, understanding, 
trust, attitudes and experience of AI systems and 
their impact on society. These insights are based 
on all respondents answering survey questions 
asked about AI systems in general, as well as AI 
use in the context of three common applications 
which are likely to be used by or impact many 
people: generative AI systems, AI in healthcare, 
and AI in Human Resource applications. 
In the second section, we delve deeper 
into understanding how employees use and 
experience AI impacts in the workplace. In the 
third section, we examine student use of AI and 
their perceptions of how AI impacts education. 
Together, these sections provide evidence-based 
insights on the following questions:
•	 To what extent do people use and understand 
AI systems? 
•	 To what extent do people trust and accept 
AI systems?
•	 How do people view and experience the 
benefits and risks of AI? 
•	 What do people expect from the regulation 
and governance of AI? 
•	 What are the key drivers of AI trust and 
acceptance in society?
•	 How is AI being used at work and with what 
impacts?
•	 How is AI being used by students and with 
what impacts?
The final section draws out the key conclusions 
and implications from these insights for industry, 
government, and the education sector. We next 
outline the research methodology.

How the 
research was
conducted
48,340 
people completed the survey 
across 47 countries and 
jurisdictions, covering all 
global geographical regions8: 
1.	 North America (Canada, United 
States of America [USA])
2.	 Latin America and Caribbean 
(Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, 
Costa Rica, Mexico)
3.	 Northern and Western Europe 
(Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, 
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, 
Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, 
United Kingdom [UK])
4.	 Southern Europe (Greece, Italy, 
Portugal, Slovenia, Spain)
5.	 Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia)
6.	 Africa (Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa)
7.	 Western Asia (Israel, Saudi Arabia, 
Türkiye, United Arab Emirates [UAE])
8.	 Eastern, Southern and Central Asia 
(China,9 , India, Japan, Republic of 
Korea, Singapore)
9.	 Oceania (Australia, New Zealand)
How the data was collected 
Data was collected in each country between 
November 2024 and mid-January 2025 using 
an online survey. 
Countries were selected based on three criteria: 
1) representation across global regions;
2) leadership in AI activity and readiness,10 and 
3) diversity on the Responsible AI Index.11 
The sample size in each country ranged from 
1,001 to 1,098 respondents. 
Analysis of the data revealed a distinct pattern 
of findings across countries with emerging 
and advanced economies. We adopted the 
International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) classification 
of advanced and emerging economies. The 
emerging economies surveyed are Argentina, 
Brazil, Chile, China,12 Colombia, Costa Rica, 
Egypt, Hungary, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Poland, 
Romania, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Türkiye,
and UAE.
Surveys were conducted in the native language(s) 
of each country with the option to complete 
in English, if preferred. To ensure question 
equivalence across countries, surveys were 
professionally translated and back translated 
from English to each respective language, using 
separate translators. See Appendix 1 for further 
method details.

Who completed the survey?
Representative research panels were used 
to ensure the people who completed the 
survey are representative of the population.13
This approach is common in survey research. 
Samples were nationally representative of 
the adult population on gender, age and regional 
distribution matched against official national 
statistics. In select countries, full representation 
on these criteria was not obtainable (see Appendix 2 
for further details on country sampling). 
Across the total sample, the gender balance 
was 51 percent women, 49 percent men and 
<1 percent other gender identities. The mean age 
was 46 years and ranged between 18 and 95 years. 
Half the sample (51%) had a university education 
and 20 percent a vocational or trade qualification. 
The sample represented the full range of income 
levels, with the majority (72%) reporting middle 
incomes (see Appendix 1 for details of the 
income measure).14
Sixty-seven percent of respondents were currently 
working full-time or part-time. These respondents 
represented the diversity of industries and 
occupational groups listed by the OECD and 
International Labor Organization15 and included 
employees of small, medium, and large organizations, 
business owners, and people who were self-
employed (e.g. sole traders and freelancers).
Five percent of respondents were students, with 
the majority tertiary students enrolled in university 
education (65%) or a vocational, trade or technical 
program (16%), and the remainder in secondary 
education (18%).
Further details of the sample representativeness, 
including the demographic profile for each country 
sample, are shown in Appendix 2.

How we asked about AI
After asking a series of questions about 
respondents’ understanding of AI, the following 
description of AI, adapted from the OECD 
definition,16 was provided: Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) refers to machine-based systems that infer 
from the input they receive and objectives 
provided, how to generate outputs such as 
predictions, content, recommendations, or 
decisions. Different AI systems vary in their 
levels of autonomy and adaptiveness.
As attitudes toward AI systems may depend on 
their purpose and use, survey questions that 
asked about the use of AI systems in society 
referred to one of four AI use cases (randomly 
allocated, see below): Generative AI (used 
to create output and content in response to 
user prompts); Healthcare AI (used to inform 
decisions about how to diagnose and treat 
patients); Human Resources AI (used to inform 
decisions about hiring and promotion); and AI 
systems in general.
These use cases were selected to represent 
AI applications that are widely and increasingly 
used and can impact many people, and were 
developed based on expert input. Respondents 
were provided with a description of the AI 
use case allocated to them, before answering 
questions related to AI systems.
Generative AI
A form of AI used to create 
content such as text, 
images, audio, and video 
based on user prompts. It 
works by processing these 
prompts and generating 
new content based on 
patterns and structures it 
has learned from extensive 
amounts of data. People 
use generative AI for a 
wide range of applications, 
such as writing, 
programming, personalized 
education, administrative 
support, product design 
and development, 
forecasting, and creating 
art and music.
Human Resources AI
An AI system used to help 
select the most suitable 
applicants for a job, 
identify employees who 
are most likely to perform 
well in a job, and predict 
who is most likely to quit. 
It works by collecting 
and comparing worker 
characteristics, employee 
data, and performance over 
time, and analyzing which 
qualities are related to 
better job performance and 
job retention. Managers 
use Human Resources AI 
to inform decisions about 
hiring and promotion.
Healthcare AI
An AI system used to 
improve the diagnosis 
of disease (e.g. cancer), 
inform the best treatment 
options, and predict health 
outcomes based on patient 
data. It works by comparing 
a patient’s health data (e.g. 
symptoms, test and scan 
results, medical history, 
family history, age, weight 
and gender, etc.) to large 
datasets based on many 
patients. Doctors use 
Healthcare AI to inform 
decisions about patient 
diagnosis and treatment.

How the data was analyzed
Statistical analyses were conducted to examine 
differences between countries and economic 
groups (e.g. countries with advanced and 
emerging economies, as classified by the 
IMF), and demographic factors (e.g. gender, 
age, education, income, occupation). Relevant 
differences are reported when statistically 
significant and meaningful. Correlational analyses 
and statistical models indicate associations 
between concepts and do not infer causality. 
Further details of the statistical procedures are 
discussed in Appendix 1. An overview of key 
indicators for each country sample are shown 
in Appendix 3.
How changes in trust, use and attitudes 
over time were assessed 
To understand how trust, use, and attitudes 
toward AI have shifted over time, a selection 
of questions was asked in the same way in 
the 2022 and 2024 surveys.
The 2022 survey included 17 countries: 
Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Estonia, 
Finland, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, 
Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, Korea, 
the UK, and the USA.17
While the samples collected in 2022 and 2024 
are based on the same methodology and sample 
representativeness, they are independent of each 
other. As such, our analyses examine general 
trends rather than a longitudinal analysis of the 
same respondents over time. Relevant insights 
on these changes are highlighted in call-out 
boxes throughout the report (for an overview, 
see Appendix 4).

Public attitudes 
towards AI
SECTION ONE
In this first section, we examine the public’s adoption and 
understanding of AI and their trust, acceptance, and emotions 
towards the use of AI systems in society. We explore people’s 
expectations and experience of positive and negative impacts 
from AI systems, how they view the benefits relative to the risks, 
and expectations of AI regulation and governance. We test a 
model identifying key predictors of AI trust and acceptance and 
explore how people from various demographic groups differ in 
their attitudes toward and use of AI.

To what extent do people use 
and understand AI systems? 
To contextualize the findings and provide an indicator of overall public 
adoption of AI and AI literacy levels, we first examine people’s use and 
understanding of AI systems and how this varies across countries. 
To identify levels of AI literacy, survey participants self-reported their 
level of AI knowledge and efficacy together with AI-related education 
and training. They were also asked about their objective understanding 
of AI use in common technologies and interest in learning more about AI.
In subsequent sections of the report, employees’ and students’ use of AI 
at work and for educational purposes are examined in more detail, together 
with organizational support for AI literacy.
Public adoption of AI is high: Two in 
three people report intentional regular 
use of AI tools for either personal, 
work, or study purposes
People were asked to report how often 
they intentionally use AI tools, clarifying 
that this use is different from the passive 
use of AI (e.g. when AI operates behind 
the scenes in tools such as email filters 
and search engines).
Two thirds of people (66%) report 
intentionally using AI on a regular basis 
for personal, work, or study reasons. As 
shown in Figure 1, two in five (38%) people 
report using AI on a weekly or daily basis, 
whereas just over a quarter (28%) use AI 
semi-regularly (i.e. every month or every 
few months). One-third (34%) rarely or 
never intentionally use AI. 
Three in five (59%) use AI at least semi-
regularly for personal purposes, with those 
not working or studying much less likely to 
use AI (only 37%). Three in five (58%) people 
who work intentionally use AI regularly for 
work purposes, while four in five (83%) 
students regularly use AI in their studies. 
This high level of adoption reflects the 
ease with which AI systems—particularly 
general-purpose generative AI tools—can 
be accessed and used by a diverse range 
of people and applied to a broad variety of 
tasks. This sets AI apart from many other 
advanced technologies that have greater 
barriers and constraints on access and 
use by individuals. 
38%
of people report 
using AI on a weekly 
or daily basis.

There are notable differences across 
countries in people’s adoption of AI, with 
emerging economies leading the way
There is a distinct pattern of findings between 
countries with advanced and emerging 
economies, with the use of AI tools notably 
higher in countries with emerging economies. 
On average, four in five (80%) people in emerging 
economies intentionally use AI tools on a regular 
or semi-regular basis, compared to three in five 
(58%) in advanced economies.
As shown in Figure 2, levels of AI use in most 
emerging economies exceed 70 percent of the 
population, with India and Nigeria reporting the 
highest regular or semi-regular usage (92%). Two 
emerging economies located in Eastern Europe—
Hungary and Romania—have notably lower AI 
use compared to the other emerging economies.
In contrast, AI use levels in most advanced 
economies fall below 70 percent of the population, 
with the lowest usage reported in the Netherlands 
(43%) and the highest in Singapore (73%).

Most people have no AI training and half 
don’t feel they understand AI, yet 3 in 5 
believe they can use AI effectively
Despite high levels of adoption, the majority of 
people report they have not received any form of 
AI training or education. Only two in five (39%) 
report some form of AI training, such as work-
based AI training, formal or informal AI training 
outside of work, or completing a university-level 
course related to AI (such as computer science 
or data analytics; see Figure 3).
In line with these low levels of AI training, 
almost half (48%) report limited knowledge 
about AI, indicating that they do not feel they 
understand AI nor when or how it is used.18 
As shown in Figure 4, only one in five people 
report high levels of knowledge, and about a 
third report a moderate level.
Despite low levels of AI education, training and 
knowledge, 60 percent of people believe they 
can use AI effectively. This includes their ability to 
choose, use and communicate with AI systems 
to support everyday activities, and evaluate the 
accuracy of AI output (see Figure 5). This is likely 
because many AI tools and systems are designed 
to be intuitive to use and accessible to a broad 
range of people (via a mobile phone application, 
for example, and by using natural language to 
make requests), enabling these tools to be used 
widely with limited or no training. For example, AI 
voice assistants can be used simply by conversing 
with these tools.

AI training, knowledge, and efficacy 
are lowest in the advanced economies
In line with the distinct differences in the use 
of AI across economic groups, there are also 
pronounced differences between advanced and 
emerging economies when it comes to levels of 
AI training, knowledge, and efficacy. 
As shown in Figure 6, half of the people surveyed 
in emerging economies report having completed 
AI-related training or education, compared 
to less than a third in advanced economies. 
Similarly, almost two-thirds of people in emerging 
economies report moderate or high knowledge 
about AI, compared to less than half in advanced 
economies. Around three-quarters of those in the 
emerging economies feel they can use AI tools 
and systems effectively, compared to only half in 
advanced economies.

A third are unaware that AI enables 
common applications they use: half 
don’t know AI is used in social media
As an indicator of people’s objective awareness 
of AI use, respondents were asked if they use 
the three common technologies shown in Figure 
8, and whether these technologies are enabled 
by AI (i.e. whether these technologies rely on 
AI to function). Seventy-nine percent of people 
use these common AI-enabled technologies—
highlighting the prevalence of AI technologies 
in people’s lives—but over a third (36%) are 
unaware that these technologies use AI. 
Use of the technology does not necessarily 
translate into an increased understanding of 
whether AI is part of it. For example, while the 
Self-reported understanding of AI has not changed over time and many are still 
unaware that AI is used in common applications like social media 
Despite the rapid uptake of AI since 2022, there has been no overall substantive change in self-
reported knowledge of AI (M=2.6 in 2022; M=2.6 in 2024). However, increases were found in 
four countries, Estonia, Brazil, China and South Africa, with the largest increases in Estonia (26% 
vs. 50%, M=2.1 vs. 2.8) and Brazil (38% vs. 63%, M=2.5 vs. 3.0).
Although use of AI in common technologies such as social media, facial recognition, and virtual 
assistants has tended to remain constant or increased in most countries, many are still unaware that 
these technologies rely on AI to function. For example, social media use has remained constant and 
high over time across countries (88% use at both time points), yet many are still unaware that 
AI is used in social media platforms (2022: 44% vs. 2024: 46%).

majority (90%) of the sample reports using social 
media, nearly half (47%) of all respondents are 
unaware of AI’s role in social media. As shown in 
Figure 8, this pattern of using technology without 
realizing it relies on AI is particularly strong for 
social media, but also evident in facial recognition 
and virtual assistants—prompting the question of 
whether the awareness of AI’s central role in these 
technologies would change how people engage 
with them.
People in emerging economies are more likely 
to be aware that AI is used in these technologies 
than those in advanced countries (70% vs. 
61%), and they are also more likely to use these 
common AI-enabled technologies (88% vs. 74%).

Four in five want to learn more about 
AI, with interest highest in emerging 
economies
Most people (83%) are interested in learning 
more about AI, ranging from almost all (97%) 
in Nigeria to three in five (59%) in Australia. 
In most emerging economies, over 90 percent 
of people express a desire to learn more about 
AI. In contrast, respondents in seven advanced 
economies (Australia, New Zealand, the USA, 
Canada, the UK, Japan and Finland) have 
considerably lower interest (ranging from 59-
67%), compared to other countries. Australia 
and Finland are notably low, with two in five 
(41%) people reporting no or low interest in 
learning more about AI. 
In summary
Taken together, these findings indicate high rates of AI adoption by the 
public, coupled with comparably low levels of AI training and literacy. Low 
levels of AI literacy may limit people’s ability to recognize the capabilities 
and applications of AI and thus fully realize benefits, and importantly, the 
ability to recognize the limitations of AI systems, critically evaluate their 
outputs, and guard against harm. For instance, social media users that 
are unaware of how algorithms shape content may fail to question the 
credibility or biases of algorithmically curated content and face increased 
vulnerability to misinformation and manipulation. 
The findings also reveal accelerated uptake of AI tools and higher levels 
of AI literacy amongst people in emerging economies compared to 
advanced economies. This may be explained in part by the increasingly 
important role that emerging and transformative technologies play in 
the economic development of these countries.19 As discussed in the 
next sections, people in emerging economies also tend to be more 
trusting, accepting, and positive about AI and experience the most 
benefits from its use, compared to those in advanced economies.
In most emerging 
economies, over
90%
of people express a desire 
to learn more about AI 
People with AI knowledge and efficacy tend 
to be more interested in learning more about 
AI (r=.48), suggesting a virtuous cycle where 
those who are already knowledgeable and 
confident in using AI are more eager to 
learn and thus more likely to deepen their 
understanding further. In contrast, those 
with low knowledge and efficacy may fall 
further behind.

To what extent do people trust 
and accept AI systems?
To answer this question, respondents were asked about their trust and 
acceptance of a range of AI systems, and the extent to which they perceive 
them to be trustworthy. They were also asked about the emotions they feel 
when it comes to AI applications.
Our approach to measuring trust in AI aligns with the following common 
definition of trust: a willingness to be vulnerable to an AI system (e.g. by 
relying on system recommendations or output or sharing personal data) 
based on positive expectations of how the system will operate (such as 
accuracy, helpfulness, data privacy and security).20 
People have more trust in the technical 
ability of AI systems to provide a helpful 
service but are more skeptical of its 
safety, security and impact on people
While most people use AI tools, many people 
have reservations about the trustworthiness of 
AI systems and their use in society. 
On average, 58 percent of people view AI 
systems as trustworthy.21 People have more faith 
in the technical ability of AI systems to provide 
accurate and reliable output and services (65%) 
than in their safety, security, impact on people, 
and ethical soundness (e.g. that they are fair, 
do no harm, and uphold privacy rights; 52%).
This difference is consistent across countries, 
as shown in Figure 9. To illustrate, in Finland—a 
country where trustworthiness is very low—half 
of the respondents view AI systems as providing 
a helpful service, yet only a third agree that 
these systems are safe and secure to use. By 
contrast, in Egypt—where AI is perceived as highly 
trustworthy—83 percent believe AI systems are 
accurate and provide a helpful service, while 72 
percent agree that they are safe and secure to use.
Trust is important because it underpins the 
acceptance and sustained adoption of AI. 
This is confirmed by our research: trust is 
associated with the acceptance and approval 
of AI systems (r=.70) and the use of AI (r=.48). 
People who trust AI systems are more likely 
to use them frequently.
How trust in AI was measured
To understand how people view the 
trustworthiness of AI systems, we asked about 
two key components: the technical ability of AI 
(e.g. to provide accurate and reliable output and a 
helpful service), and safe and ethical use (e.g. to 
be safe and secure to use and ethically sound).
We also examined two primary ways people 
demonstrate trust in AI systems: Reliance 
assesses people’s willingness to rely on an AI 
system’s output, such as a recommendation 
or decision (i.e. to trust that it is accurate). 
Information sharing relates to the willingness 
to share information or data with an AI system 
(e.g. to provide personal information to enable 
the system to work or perform a service).

Most people are ambivalent or unwilling 
to trust AI systems but accept their use
The concern about the safety and security of AI 
and its impact on people helps explain why a little 
over half (54%) of people are wary about trusting 
AI systems, reporting either ambivalence or an 
unwillingness to trust (see Figure 10). Only 46 
percent are willing to trust AI systems.
As people’s trust in AI may vary depending on the 
application of AI, we asked about trust in different 
AI use cases. As shown in Figure 10, there are 
similar levels of trust in generative AI tools, AI use 
in Human Resources, and AI systems in general 
(42-45% are willing to trust, Ms=3.9-4.0). 
One difference is that people are more trusting 
of AI use in healthcare (52% willing, M=4.3), 
with healthcare the most trusted application in 
42 of the 47 countries surveyed (see Figure 11). 
This difference likely reflects the direct benefit 
that increased precision of medical diagnoses 
and treatments affords people, combined 
with generally high levels of trust in medical 
professionals in most countries.22 These findings 
reinforce that people’s trust of AI systems is 
contextual and can depend on the use case 
and their confidence in the organization that is 
deploying the AI system. 
Most people report low or moderate acceptance 
and approval of the use of AI systems (see 
Figure 10), with moderate acceptance indicating 
a level of ambivalence in their acceptance of AI 
use. In contrast, a third report high acceptance 
and approval. Taken together, these findings 
show that the majority (72%) have at least some 
level of acceptance of AI use.

Trust and acceptance of AI is lower in 
advanced economies
As shown in Figure 12, trust and acceptance of 
AI systems are consistently lower in advanced 
economies compared to emerging economies. 
In advanced economies, two in five are willing to 
trust AI systems by relying on their output and 
sharing information with these systems. Half view 
AI systems as trustworthy, and two-thirds report 
at least moderate levels of acceptance. 
In contrast, people in emerging economies have 
more trust in AI systems, view them as more 
trustworthy, and have higher levels of acceptance 
and approval of their use. It is notable, however, 
that 43 percent of people in emerging economies 
remain ambivalent or unwilling to trust AI 
systems, highlighting that trust cannot be taken 
for granted.
To illustrate this distinction at the country level, 
as shown in Figure 13, over half of the people 
surveyed trust AI systems in 12 of the 17 
emerging economies (ranging from 
41 percent in Poland to 79 percent in Nigeria). 
Trust and acceptance are particularly high in the 
six emerging economies of Nigeria, India, Egypt, 
China, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—with over 
60 percent of people willing to trust AI and at 
least 49 percent reporting high acceptance. 
These countries also have the highest levels 
of AI use and AI literacy, as previously reported.
In contrast, less than half trust AI systems in 25 
of the 29 advanced economies. Of the advanced 
economies, trust is highest in Norway,23 Spain, 
Israel, and Singapore (all over 50 percent willing 
to trust). In contrast, Finland and Japan rate the 
lowest on trust (25-28%) while New Zealand and 
Australia (15-17% high acceptance) rank lowest 
on acceptance. 
The higher trust and acceptance of AI in emerging 
economies is reflected in the accelerated uptake 
of AI in these countries.24

People have mixed emotions about AI: 
both optimism and worry prevail
People feel a range of emotions about AI 
applications. As shown in Figure 14, the majority 
feel optimistic and excited, while also worried— 
demonstrating a degree of emotional ambivalence.
People in emerging economies report more 
positive emotions toward AI and a clear 
divergence between positive and negative 
sentiment. Optimism and excitement are 
dominant emotions in emerging economies, 
experienced by 74-82 percent of people. 
Significantly fewer (56%) feel worried.
In contrast, people in advanced economies feel 
both worried and optimistic in almost equal 
measure (61-64%), with just over half (51%) 
feeling excited.
Each emotion was measured on a 5-point scale, with the above ﬁgure displaying % Moderate to High = ‘Moderately’,

At least half of respondents feel worried about 
AI in all but three countries, underscoring that 
worry about AI often coexists with optimism 
and excitement in many countries.
Reinforcing this pattern, Figure 15 shows 
emotions about AI applications at the country 
level. People in many advanced economies feel 
more worried than optimistic or excited, whereas 
optimism and excitement dominate in most 
emerging economies. To illustrate, 70 percent of 
people in Japan feel worried and only 37 percent

Trust in AI systems has decreased 
over time and worry has increased
The perceived trustworthiness of AI systems 
decreased over time from 63 percent of people 
viewing AI systems as trustworthy in 2022 
to 56 percent in 2024 (M=4.8 vs. M=4.6; 
see Figure 16). This demonstrates that many 
are feeling less positive about the ability of 
AI systems to provide accurate and reliable 
output, and be safe, secure and ethical to use. 
Perceived trustworthiness decreased in 13 of the 
17 countries, with the largest decreases in Israel 
(68% to 52%) and South Africa (76% vs. 62%).
Similarly, people’s willingness to rely on AI 
systems decreased on average from 52 percent 
in 2022 to 43 percent in 2024 (M=4.3 vs. 
M=4.0; see Figure 16), with decreases in 12 of 
the 17 countries. The largest decreases occurred 
in Japan (43% to 21%) and Brazil (67% to 53%). 
This likely reflects that with increased use and 
exposure to AI systems, people have become more 
aware of their capabilities and limitations, prompting 
a more considered reliance on these tools. 
Over this same period, there is a striking increase 
in the number of people feeling worried about 
AI systems, rising from almost half (49%) of 
respondents in 2022 to 62 percent in 2024 (M=2.4 
to M=3.0). This increase was found in 15 of the 
17 countries, with the largest increases in Brazil 
(49% in 2022 vs. 75% in 2024) together with 
Israel, Estonia, the Netherlands and Finland 
(ranging from 21-26% increase in worry).
In 11 of the 17 countries, people also feel less 
excited about AI systems, with the largest 
difference in France, where just 35 percent feel 
excited about AI in 2024 (M=2.0) compared to 
58 percent in 2022 (M=2.6). The only country 
where excitement increased is Korea, where 
75 percent report feeling excited in 2024, compared 
to 57 percent in 2022 (M=3.2 vs. M=2.5).

In summary
Overall, the findings reveal considerable ambivalence toward the use 
of AI systems in society, stemming from the tension that people are 
less trusting of the safety and security of using AI systems and their 
impact on society, but are more trusting of their technical ability to 
provide a helpful service. This tension is reflected in low and ambivalent 
trust of AI, moderate acceptance, and the coexistence of optimism with 
worry, particularly for people in advanced economies. Moreover, trust in 
AI has declined over time, while worry has increased. The next section 
examines how this ambivalent trust is shaped by perceptions and 
experiences of the benefits and risks of AI systems.

How do people view and experience 
the benefits and risks of AI?
To help answer this question, we asked the extent to which people perceive 
and have observed or experienced beneficial or negative outcomes from AI, 
and if they feel the benefits of AI applications outweigh the risks.
People expect and are experiencing 
a broad range of benefits from AI 
Most people (83%) believe the use of AI will 
result in a wide range of benefits, as shown 
in Figure 17. Importantly, 73 percent of people 
are personally experiencing or observing 
these benefits.25
The most commonly expected benefits are 
also some of the most realized, with over three 
quarters reporting they have experienced or 
observed improved efficiency and effectiveness, 
reduced time spent on mundane or repetitive 
tasks and improved levels of accessibility to 
information or services.26 Increased fairness 
due to the use of AI (e.g. by reducing human 
bias) is the least commonly realized benefit, 
but it is still experienced or observed by over 
half of respondents (54%).
The utility of AI and people’s lived experience 
of its benefits help explain the widespread 
use, adoption and qualified acceptance of 
AI technologies, despite the trust concerns. 
The positive benefits experienced are largely 
performance oriented—in line with our finding 
that people are more trusting of AI’s ability to 
provide a helpful service and output.
People who expect and experience or observe 
benefits from AI are more likely to trust (r=.42-
.57), accept (r=.41-.63), and use AI (r=.40-.41).

People in emerging economies are 
more likely to expect and realize the 
benefits of AI
Ninety percent of people in emerging economies 
expect benefits from AI applications, compared 
to 79 percent in advanced economies. As shown 
in Figure 18, people in emerging economies have 
the most positive expectations of the benefits of 
AI. For instance, 95 percent of people in Nigeria 
expect a wide range of benefits. In contrast, fewer 
people expect benefits from AI in several advanced 
economies, particularly Australia, Canada, Finland, 
Japan, New Zealand, the UK and the USA.
The majority of people in emerging economies are 
also more likely to have observed or experienced 
AI benefits (82% vs. 65% in advanced economies). 
The largest differences between economies relate 
to the benefits of increased fairness (66% vs 43%), 
enhanced creativity (80% vs 59%), and improved 
outcomes for people (84% vs 64%).
AI systems may be perceived and experienced as 
more beneficial in emerging economies because 
of their ability to fill critical resource gaps and 
provide greater relative opportunities to people. 
For instance, the use of AI systems in healthcare 
has the potential to enhance service delivery and 
improve health outcomes in areas where there is 
limited access to medical professionals.

People are concerned about a range of 
negative outcomes from AI use and two in 
five are experiencing negative outcomes
While many of those surveyed are experiencing 
significant benefits from AI use, the majority 
(79%) are also concerned about a broad range 
of risks and negative outcomes from AI use (see 
Figure 20). Many of these risks are at the societal 
level, impacting society broadly rather than having 
isolated impacts on the individuals who use AI.27 
Cybersecurity risk (e.g. from hacking or malware) 
is a dominant concern raised by 85 percent 
of people, together with the loss of human 
interaction and connection (e.g. losing the option 
to speak with a human service provider). Other 
risks raised by over 80 percent of people include 
misinformation and disinformation (e.g. AI used 
to spread misleading or false information and 
deepfakes), manipulation or harmful use, loss 
of privacy or intellectual property (IP), deskilling 
and dependency, and job loss. 
In comparison, people are less concerned about 
the risk of bias or unfair treatment from AI use 
or the environmental impact (68-69%). This may 
reflect a lack of awareness of the potential for AI 
systems to codify existing biases in datasets, and 
the high energy usage required to develop some 
AI systems and power the data centers they rely 
on. Although the percentages are lower, bias and 
environmental impact remain clear concerns for 
more than two thirds of people.
In addition to being concerned about the risks 
of AI applications, two in five have personally 
experienced or observed these negative 
outcomes (43%; see Figure 20). The loss of 
human interaction and connection, inaccurate 
outcomes, and misinformation and disinformation 
are the most commonly experienced negative 
outcomes from AI (52-55%). Bias or unfair 
treatment is the least commonly experienced or 
observed outcome, but it was still experienced 
by almost a third of people.

The risks of AI are viewed and experienced 
in a comparable way across countries
In contrast to the differences across countries in 
how people view the benefits of AI, there are few 
differences across countries in people’s concerns 
about the risks: the same proportion of people 
are concerned about negative outcomes from AI 
in both advanced and emerging economies (79% 
and 78%, respectively) and the majority of people 
in all countries report moderate or high concern 
about these risks (ranging from 67% in China to 
87% in Greece). 
As shown in Figure 21, the top concerns in 
almost all countries are either cybersecurity risks 
or the loss of human connection. China, Egypt, 
Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and South Africa are the 
exceptions, where job loss is the primary or an 
equal concern. There are also commonalities in 
what people are least concerned about, with 
either the environmental impacts of AI or the 
potential risk of bias from AI ranking last in 
every country. 
The experience or observation of negative 
outcomes is also similar across economies 
(Emerging: 46% vs. Advanced: 40%). However, 
as shown in Figure 22, there is a trend for people 
in emerging economies to be more likely to have 
experienced or observed job loss due to AI 
(46% vs. 34% in advanced economies). 
People in emerging economies are 
more likely to believe the benefits of AI 
outweigh the risks: opinion is divided in 
advanced countries
Globally, 42 percent of people believe the 
benefits of AI outweigh the risks, compared to 
32 percent who believe the risks outweigh the 
benefits, and 26 percent who believe benefits 
and risks are balanced. This aligns with the 
finding that more people report experiencing 
benefits from AI than negative outcomes.
However, there are significant country 
differences in how people perceive the balance 
between AI risks and benefits. Half of people in 
emerging economies believe benefits outweigh 
risks, but opinions are more divided in advanced 
economies, where 38 percent believe the 
benefits outweigh risks and an almost equal 
number (37%) believe the risks outweigh the 
benefits. This aligns with the previously reported 
finding that more people in emerging economies 
expect and experience benefits from AI.
As shown in Figure 23, over 60 percent believe 
benefits outweigh risks in Nigeria, China, and 
Egypt (from 61% in Egypt to 74% in Nigeria). 
In contrast, a third or less agree that the 
benefits outweigh the risks in Australia, 
New Zealand, the Netherlands, Sweden, 
Finland, Canada, Ireland, and France. 
Although perspectives on AI vary across 
economies, in no country does the belief that 
AI risks outweigh the benefits reach 50 percent. 
This suggests that, despite concerns, most 
people in all countries acknowledge the benefits 
of AI systems.

In summary
Taken together, the extensive range of benefits and negative outcomes 
experienced from AI use highlights the paradoxical impacts of AI 
systems on individuals and society. For example, depending on how it 
is implemented and for what purpose, AI systems can either increase 
fairness or augment bias, facilitate accurate information or contribute 
to misinformation, enhance what people can do or deskill people. 
As with all powerful technologies that augment capabilities and offer 
transformative opportunities for advancement and growth while also 
augmenting risks and negative outcomes, AI systems require careful 
management and governance, together with guardrails and guidance 
to ensure appropriate and responsible use and prevent harm. 
It is with this in mind that we turn next to examine the public’s 
expectations of the regulation and governance of AI.
Concern about the risks of AI has 
increased with fewer believing that 
the benefits outweigh the risks
The view that the benefits of AI outweigh 
the risks has decreased from 2022 to 
2024 from 50 percent to 41 percent 
(M=4.4 vs. M=4.1). This reflects a 
decline in 15 of the 17 countries, with 
the largest reductions in Brazil and India. 
For example, in Brazil the belief that the 
benefits of AI outweigh the risks fell from 
71 percent in 2022 to 44 percent in 2024 
(M=5.0 vs. M=4.5) and in India it fell from 
72 percent to 55 percent (M=5.2 vs. 4.6).
In line with this change and the increase 
in worry about AI previously report, 
concern about the risks of AI systems 
increased in nine countries. The largest 
increases were in the Netherlands 
(up from 67% feeling concerned about 
AI risks in 2022 to 85% in 2024, M=3.1 
vs. 3.5) and Germany (65% vs. 79%, 
M=3.0 vs. 3.4). There was no reduction 
in the perceived risks from AI systems 
over time in any country. 
In contrast, there was no change in 
the perceived benefits from AI in most 
countries, with small increases or 
decreases in five countries.

What do people expect from the 
regulation and governance of AI?
Given the risks and benefits associated with AI, we asked people about 
their expectations of the regulation and governance of AI including whether 
regulation is necessary, whether current regulation and institutional 
safeguards are sufficient, and who should regulate AI. We also explored 
who is trusted to develop and use AI, and the role of governance and 
assurance mechanisms in supporting trust in AI.
Before presenting findings on public perceptions 
of AI regulation, it is important to recognize that 
regulatory approaches vary significantly across 
jurisdictions. For example, the European Union 
has adopted the comprehensive EU AI Act, 
while other jurisdictions are at different stages 
of maturity—ranging from developing AI-specific 
frameworks to relying primarily on guidelines 
or existing regulation. This diversity highlights 
the absence of a unified global approach and 
provides important context for interpreting 
public perceptions of AI regulation.
The majority in almost all countries 
surveyed believe AI regulation 
is required 
Given the perceived and experienced risks 
and impacts of AI, it is not surprising that 
70 percent of people across countries globally 
believe AI regulation is required. Only 17 percent 
believe that AI regulation is not needed, with 
the remaining 13 percent unsure. This finding 
corroborates our prior survey findings, and 
other independent surveys indicating strong 
public desire for the regulation of AI.28 
As shown in Figure 24, the majority of people in 
all countries view AI regulation as a necessity. 
India is the exception, where just under half (48%) 
agree regulation is needed. In all other countries, 
the percentage reporting that AI regulation is 
needed ranges between 57 percent in the UAE 
to 86 percent in Finland. 
This broad public consensus of the need to 
regulate AI supports the many national and 
international efforts to regulate and govern AI to 
minimize negative societal outcomes and harm.

The current regulatory landscape is not 
meeting public expectations: Only two 
in five people believe current regulation 
and laws governing AI are sufficient
The majority (57%) of people disagree or 
are unsure that current regulation, laws and 
safeguards are sufficient to make AI use safe 
and protect people from harm (see Figure 25). 
Only two in five (43%) believe that regulation 
and laws governing AI systems are sufficient. 
This finding aligns with prior surveys29 indicating 
people want more effective regulation of AI.
This pattern is strongest in the advanced 
economies, where only 37 percent view current 
regulation and laws as adequate. As evidenced 
in Figure 25, a third or less view regulation 
as adequate in the advanced economies of 
New Zealand, Finland, Japan, Sweden, Canada, 
the USA, Australia, Ireland, France, the UK, 
and Germany. 
In contrast, 55 percent of people in emerging 
economies view the safeguards around AI as 
sufficient. This predominantly reflects the six 
countries where a significant majority believe 
current safeguards are sufficient, namely India, 
Nigeria, China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, 
and Egypt.
To further understand the adequacy of current 
regulation and laws, respondents were asked if 
there is too much regulation of AI. 
In the advanced economies, the dominant 
response is to disagree (45%), followed by those 
who are neutral or don’t know (35%). Only one 
in five (20%) agree that there is already too 
much regulation of AI. People in the emerging 
economies, are more evenly split, with about a 
third (32%) disagreeing that there is too much 
regulation, another third (30%) neutral or reporting 
that they don’t know, and 38 percent agreeing. 
The country-level data shows that the only 
countries where the majority believe there is too 
much AI regulation are India, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, 
and the UAE. 
The strong association between perceived 
adequacy of AI regulation with trust (r=.67), 
acceptance (r=.64), and use of AI (r=.45), and 
confidence in organizations to develop and use 
AI in the public interest (r=.51) highlights the 
importance of developing an effective regulatory 
framework to underpin AI adoption.

Most people are not aware of laws, 
regulation or policy that apply to AI
These views about the adequacy of regulation 
and laws may reflect, in part, low awareness of 
the regulatory landscape, given four in five people 
(83%) are not aware of any laws, regulation or 
government policy that apply to AI within their 
respective country. 
There is significant variation across countries, 
ranging from 5 percent awareness of AI regulation 
in the Czech Republic to 49 percent in China. 
Awareness is highest in the emerging economies 
of Nigeria, Costa Rica, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the 
UAE, India and China (ranging from 27 percent 
to 49 percent aware). Amongst the advanced 
economies, awareness is notably highest 
in Norway (32%), followed by Estonia, Latvia, 
Singapore and Switzerland (24% respectively), and 
under 17 percent in other advanced economies.30 
There is a strong public mandate for 
international and national regulation of AI 
As shown in Figure 26, a clear majority of people 
(between 64% and 76%) support multiple forms 
of regulation. Three in four expect international 
laws and regulation and seven in ten expect co-
regulation by industry, government, and existing 
regulators, and independent oversight from their 
country’s government and existing regulators. 
Just under two thirds expect governance from 
industries that use or develop AI systems and a 
dedicated, independent AI regulator.
As shown in Figure 27, international laws and 
regulation was the most endorsed form of 
regulation in most countries. A clear majority 
of people in all countries support having 
international laws and regulation, with agreement 
ranging from 60% to 86%. This may reflect an 
appreciation that many AI platforms operate 
across borders and are often developed and used 
by multinational organizations headquartered 
outside of one’s own country, requiring laws and 
regulation at the international level to ensure 
oversight and application across jurisdictions. 
In addition to international laws and regulation, 
people in most countries express a preference for 
national government regulation or a co-regulatory 
approach between government and industry, over 
self-regulation by industry or an independent AI 
regulator. However, it is notable that a majority in 
almost all countries endorse each of these forms 
of regulation, in line with the broad reach, uptake 
and impact of AI across multiple sectors and 
levels of society.
These findings indicate the public has a strong, 
shared expectation of a multipronged regulatory 
approach at international and national levels to 
govern AI, with active involvement from both 
government and industry.

People who have AI training or education, or

and regulations that apply to AI (r=.34-.42). 
This suggests that one pathway to lift regulatory 
awareness is through AI literacy programs.

A clear public mandate for stronger 
regulation of AI-generated misinformation
We further examined impacts and expectations 
related to AI-generated misinformation and 
disinformation. As shown earlier in the report 
(see Figure 20), this is a key concern for the 
majority of people.
Our findings suggest that AI-generated 
misinformation is eroding trust in online content, 
with ripple effects for trust in elections. As shown 
in Figure 28, 70 percent of people are unsure 
if online content can be trusted because they 
don’t know if content is real or AI-generated, 
and 64 percent are concerned that elections are 
being manipulated by AI-powered bots and AI-
generated content. This is further exacerbated 
by the fact that over half of people do not feel 
they can identify AI-generated misinformation.
Given these concerns, almost nine in ten 
respondents say they want stronger laws and 
actions to combat AI-generated misinformation. 
A large majority agree that there should be 
laws to prevent the spread of AI-generated 
misinformation. They want news and social media 
companies to implement stronger fact-checking 
processes to combat AI-generated misinformation, 
and methods (such as watermarking) to allow 
people to detect when content is AI generated.

Organizational assurance mechanisms 
enhance trust in AI systems
In addition to external rules, laws, and 
safeguards, we asked about a range of assurance 
mechanisms available to organizations to support 
and signal their trustworthy and responsible 
use of AI. These mechanisms range from 
monitoring system reliability to human oversight 
and accountability, responsible AI policies and 
training, adhering to international AI standards, 
and independent third-party AI assurance 
systems (see Figure 29).
Four out of five (83%) report they would be 
more willing to trust an AI system when such 
assurance mechanisms are in place. 
Each of these assurance mechanisms is viewed 
as important for trust across all countries (ranging 
from 69% in Japan to 89% in Türkiye and Nigeria). 
This indicates that these mechanisms can play a 
key role in strengthening trust in organizational AI 
use across diverse markets.

People have most confidence in 
universities and healthcare organizations 
to develop and use AI 
As shown in Figure 30, people have the most 
confidence in their country’s universities, research 
institutions, and healthcare organizations to 
develop and use AI in the best interests of the 
public. Between 78 percent and 88 percent report 
moderate to high confidence in these entities in 
advanced and emerging economies, respectively.
People are less confident in their government’s 
use of AI. Between 58 percent and 65 percent 
report moderate to high confidence in their 
national government to develop and use AI in 
the best interests of the public in advanced and 
emerging economies, respectively. However, two 
in five (40%) report low confidence. Addressing 
this low confidence in governmental use of AI 
will be important going forward to realize the 
many beneficial applications of AI use in public 
sector service delivery, including enabling 
equitable access to government services and 
enhancing the personalization, effectiveness 
and efficiency of service delivery. 
There is significant variation across countries in 
people’s confidence in government. Half or more 
(50 to 67%) lack confidence in their government 
to develop and use AI in the public's best interest 
in Argentina, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Japan, the USA, 
Colombia, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, Greece, 
the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In contrast, 
as shown in Figure 31, most people in Norway, 
Singapore, India, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and 
China have confidence in their government 
(ranging between 65% and 90%).
People in emerging economies report greater 
confidence in big technology companies, 
like Apple, Facebook/Meta, Google/Alphabet, 
Huawei, OpenAI and Tencent (84% vs 64% 
confident) and commercial organizations, such 
as retailers and banks (75% vs 60%), than those 
in advanced economies. For example, as shown 
in Figure 31, over 90 percent of people in China, 
Nigeria, India, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have 
moderate to high confidence in big technology 
firms. In comparison, countries with advanced 
economies tend to have lower confidence in 
big technology firms, such as France, the UK, 
Sweden, the USA, Denmark, Canada, Australia 
and New Zealand (ranging from 60% in France 
to 46% in New Zealand).
This highlights the potential opportunity for 
commercial organizations, big technology firms, 
and government to collaborate with universities 
and research institutions in the development of AI.
There has been no change in the perceived 
adequacy of AI safeguards over time, however 
the importance of organizational assurance 
mechanisms for trust has increased
The belief that AI regulation is needed has 
remained constant over time (71% in 2022 
vs 71% in 2024; M=2.5 vs. 2.6), as has the 
perceived adequacy of current regulations and 
laws (M=4.0 at both time points). However, 
there is a trend towards fewer people viewing 
current AI regulations as adequate in nine 
countries, largest reduction evident in Germany 
(41% agree in 2022 vs. 31% in 2024).
Given the increase in perceived risks of AI 
previously reported, it is not surprising that 
the importance of organizational assurance 
mechanisms has increased over time. Eighty 
percent of people in 2024 reported they 
would be more likely to trust AI systems when 
organizational assurance mechanisms are in 
place, compared to 72 percent in 2022 (M=5.6 
vs. M=5.0). There were significant increases 
in all 17 countries, with the largest in Canada, 
the UK and Finland (ranging from 69-74% in 
2022 to 81-84% in 2024).
When people are confident in entities to develop 
and use AI, they are more likely to trust (r=.54) 
and accept AI systems (r=.52), accept AI 
systems (r=.52), and use AI (r=.40).

In summary
Taken together, these findings reveal a clear public desire for stronger 
regulation and governance of AI systems that is fit-for-purpose in 
supporting safe and trustworthy use. The majority expect robust 
international and national regulation, but many do not believe that the 
current safeguards around AI are sufficient. There is also widespread 
support for stronger legislation and action that specifically targets AI-
generated misinformation.
The low level of public awareness of laws governing AI likely reflects 
that many jurisdictions are still in an early phase of designing and 
implementing regulatory frameworks. However, it also suggests 
a need to support people to understand if and how existing and 
emerging laws and regulation apply to AI. 
At the organizational level, the findings highlight that organizations 
can strengthen trust in their use of AI systems by putting in place 
governance and assurance mechanisms that signal trustworthy 
and responsible use. In the next section we further examine key 
pathways for supporting trust and acceptance of AI systems.

What are the key drivers of trust and 
acceptance of AI systems?
In the preceding sections, we identified that AI literacy and training, 
perceptions of the benefits and risks of AI, and the perceived adequacy of 
AI regulation and confidence in entities to use AI, are each associated with 
people’s trust and acceptance of AI systems used in society. To identify the 
most important predictors, we used a statistical technique called structural 
equation modeling.31 
The model examines four distinct pathways—reflecting knowledge, 
motivational, uncertainty, and institutional drivers—testing and comparing 
their importance in predicting trust and acceptance of AI. We show the 
model in Figure 32, together with notes on interpretation.
Trust is central to AI acceptance 
The model shows that trust is a key driver of AI 
acceptance (B=.4332), empirically supporting why 
trust in AI matters: if people are willing to trust AI 
systems, then they are more likely to accept and 
approve their use in society.
As explained below, the model further shows that 
trust acts as a central mechanism through which 
other drivers impact AI acceptance. 
AI literacy influences trust and acceptance
The knowledge pathway is based on evidence 
that knowledge, efficacy, and training—which 
each relate to AI literacy—help to enhance trust 
in technology.33 
The model shows that people are more likely 
to trust AI systems when they believe they 
understand AI and when and how it is used 
in common applications and have received AI 
education or training (B=.11). The knowledge 
pathway also has a direct impact on acceptance 
(B=.12). 
These relationships indicate the importance of 
providing people with opportunities to enhance 
their AI literacy.
The perceived benefits of AI foster 
increased trust and acceptance 
The motivational pathway to trust is grounded 
in evidence that the more people perceive 
benefits, utility, and positive outcomes from 
the use of technologies, the more they will 
be motivated to trust and accept them.34 
Expecting AI systems to produce benefits 
(B=.23) has a relatively strong influence on 
trust, as well as on levels of acceptance (B=.22). 
This relationship highlights the importance of 
designing and using AI systems in a way that 
delivers benefits to a broad range of people.

Uncertainty: risks
Knowledge: AI literacy
Institutional: safeguards 
& confidence
Motivational: benefits
AI Acceptance
Institutional drivers include:
•	 Safeguards: the belief that current laws, 
rules and governance are sufficient to 
ensure AI use is safe 
•	 Confidence in entities to develop and use 
AI in the best interests of the public
The extent to 
which people trust 
AI systems and 
perceive them to 
be trustworthy
The extent to which 
people accept and 
approve of AI systems
Knowledge drivers include indicators of 
AI literacy:
•	 AI knowledge: the extent to which people 
feel they understand AI and when and where 
it is used, including objective knowledge of 
AI use in common technologies
•	 AI efficacy: people’s self-assessed ability to 
use AI tools responsibly and effectively
•	 AI training: having completed a university 
course related to AI or received some form 
of AI training
Some demographics 
have a small impact on 
acceptance:
People in emerging 
economies are more 
accepting
People with 
university education 
are more accepting
Predictors also have a 
direct effect on acceptance 
after accounting for their 
influence via trust:

Motivational drivers include the expected 
benefits of AI: the extent to which people 
expect a range of benefits to arise from the 
use of AI systems
Uncertainty drivers include perceived 
risks of AI: the extent to which people are 
concerned about a range of risks related to 
the use of AI systems
How to read the model
When reading the model, follow the arrows from left to right. The left boxes show the four drivers of trust and 
acceptance, with notes explaining each driver in the boxes below the model. The values on the arrows indicate the 
relative importance of each driver in influencing trust and acceptance: the larger the number, the stronger the effect. 
The positive values for institutional safeguards and confidence, benefits, and knowledge, indicate that when these 
drivers increase, so do trust and acceptance. The negative value for uncertainty indicates that when perceived risks 
increase, trust and acceptance decrease. 
The model is based on all data (across countries and AI applications). All relationships shown are significant (p<.001).

The perceived risks of AI create uncertainty 
and reduce trust and acceptance
The uncertainty pathway is based on the view 
that it is more difficult to trust technologies 
in contexts of risk or when the outcomes and 
impacts of the technologies are uncertain.35
The model shows that the more concerned 
people are about the risks and potential negative 
outcomes of AI use in society, the less likely they 
are to trust the systems (B=-.08) or accept them 
(B=-.05). The impact of risk concern is notably 
smaller than that of benefit expectation, which 
helps to explain why people are willing to trust 
and accept AI systems in society and use them 
personally to gain benefits, despite concerns 
they may have about the risks.
This finding demonstrates the importance of 
proactively working to mitigate the perceived 
risks associated with AI systems at multiple 
levels and to effectively communicate the 
mitigation strategies that are in place to help 
reduce uncertainty, reassure people and 
support their trust in AI.
Institutional factors are the strongest 
drivers of trust, and also impact 
acceptance 
The institutional pathway reflects evidence that 
institutional safeguards and control mechanisms 
(e.g. laws, rules, standards) and confidence in 
the institutions deploying technologies reassure 
people of the safety, reliability and trustworthiness 
of technologies.36 
Our findings indicate that people are more 
trusting of AI systems when they believe current 
regulation and laws are sufficient to make 
AI adoption and integration into society safe 
and are confident in a range of entities—from 
government, big tech companies, commercial 
organizations, research institutions, and health 
organizations—to develop and use AI in the 
public’s best interests (B=.62). The influence 
of institutional factors on acceptance is 
comparatively smaller (B=.17), suggesting 
that much of the influence of these factors 
on acceptance occurs via trust.
The model shows the institutional pathway is 
the most important pathway to trust. However, 
the broader survey results indicate that (a) 
many are not convinced that current laws and 
regulation are sufficient, and (b) perceptions of 
the adequacy of AI regulation have not shifted 
markedly over time. This stable perception 
of existing regulation highlights an ongoing 
challenge for policymakers when it comes to 
reassuring the public that there are appropriate 
laws, regulation and safeguards in place.
The model’s predictors explain 79 percent of the 
variance in trust and 72 percent of the variance 
in acceptance. The similarity of these findings to 
the model that was tested and validated in our 
prior research report37 reinforces the importance 
of these drivers and the robustness of the model 
when tested in a larger, more diverse sample.
In summary
In summary, the modeling indicates that each of the four pathways 
play a significant and complementary role in supporting trust and 
acceptance of AI use in society.

Younger people, higher income earners, 
the university-educated, and those with AI 
training are more trusting and accepting of 
AI systems, have higher levels of AI literacy, 
and are more likely to use AI
Analyses reveal that four subgroups are more 
trusting and accepting of AI, more likely to have 
higher levels of AI knowledge and efficacy, and 
more likely to use AI. As shown in Figures 33-
35, this applies to: 
•	 People with AI-related training or education 
(vs. those without)
•	 People with high household incomes (vs. 
middle- and low-income categories)
•	 Younger people, notably those aged 18-34 
years, compared to the oldest category of 
respondents (55+) 
•	 People with a university education (vs. no 
university education)
As shown in Figure 33, those with AI-related 
education or training are almost twice as likely 
to trust and accept AI technologies compared to 
those without. Similarly, high-income earners are 
twice as likely to trust AI and three times more 
likely to have high acceptance of AI compared to 
those with lower incomes. 
How do demographic factors influence 
trust, attitudes and use of AI? 
To understand how attitudes and experiences with AI systems vary 
across demographic groups, we examined the influence of age, income, 
education, AI training, and gender on trust, acceptance, and the key drivers 
in our model. 
The analyses reveal that AI training and income consistently have the 
strongest effects. It is notable that there are no differences between men 
and women on any of the key indicators.
Over
80%
of people under 35, people 
with AI training, and those 
with high incomes use AI 
tools, compared to less than
50%
of those 55 years of age and 
older, those who do not have 
AI training, and people with 
low incomes.

In relation to the use of AI tools, over 80 percent 
of people under 35, people with AI training, and 
those with high incomes use AI tools on a regular 
basis, compared to less than 50 percent of those 
55 years of age and older, those who do not have 
AI training, and people with low incomes (see 
Figure 34).
These findings likely reflect that younger people, 
those with higher incomes, and the university-
educated are more likely to have completed AI 
training or AI-related education and have higher 
levels of AI knowledge and efficacy (see Figure 
35). For instance, 71 percent of young adults 
report moderate to high levels of AI knowledge, 
compared to 33 percent of older adults. 
80 percent of high-income earners feel confident 
about using AI, compared to 44 percent of low-
income respondents. Strikingly, 70 percent 
of those with high income report having AI 
education or training, compared to 38 percent 
of middle-income earners and just 18 percent of 
those who report low income. Over 9 in 10 (92%) 
of high-income earners are interested in learning 
more about AI, compared to just 42 percent of 
low-income earners. 
People with AI training and high-income 
earners report more benefits from AI 
Individuals with AI training and high-income 
earners are more likely to expect a range of 
benefits from AI compared to low-income earners 
and those with no AI training or education (High 
income: 90%, vs. middle: 83%, vs. low: 74%; 
AI education or training: 89%, no AI education 
or training: 79%) and report experiencing more 
positive outcomes (High income: 80%, middle 
income: 72%, low income: 60%; AI training or 
education: 79%, no AI education or training: 
63%). Higher AI literacy and use, together with 
greater access to resources, may uniquely 
position these groups to seize the benefits of AI 
use, and protect them from negative outcomes.
Regarding the experience of specific benefits, 
80 percent of people who report high income 
have experienced enhanced decision-making, 
compared to 70 percent of middle-income 
earners and just 59 percent of those with low 
income. Those with AI education or training 
are particularly more likely to have experienced 
reduced costs or better use of resources (75% 
vs. 53%), enhanced creativity (76% vs. 54%), 
and enhancing what people can do (80% vs. 
65%). Concerns about negative AI outcomes and 
experiences of such outcomes are consistent 
across all subgroups.
Those with AI training, high-income 
earners and younger people are more likely 
to view AI regulation and laws as sufficient 
People with AI training, high-income earners 
and younger people are less likely to believe 
AI regulation is necessary. Only 54 percent 
of high-income respondents agree that AI 
regulation is required, compared to between 
72 percent and 75 percent of middle- and low-
income respondents. Similarly, 61 percent of the 
youngest age group believe that AI regulation is 
required, compared to 70 percent in the middle-
age range (35-44 years) and 79 percent in older 
age categories (55+ years).
These groups are also more likely to view existing 
AI regulation as sufficient, with 69 percent of 
high-income earners agreeing, compared to just 
28 percent of low-income earners.
Over
9 in 10
high-income earners are interested 
in learning more about AI, compared 
to just 42 percent of low-income 
earners.

In summary
Taken together, the pattern of findings suggests that people who are 
younger and university educated, and particularly those with AI training 
and higher incomes, are better positioned to use and realize the benefits 
from AI. This is likely due to their higher levels of AI literacy and resources.
In the next two sections, we examine how employees and students 
use, experience and trust AI in their work and education, and their 
perceptions of how their organizations govern and support AI adoption 
and responsible use. These sections are based on the subset of survey 
respondents who identified as working or studying, respectively.

Employee attitudes 
towards AI at work
SECTION TWO
To complement insights in prior sections, respondents who were 
working full or part-time38 were asked about their use of AI for 
work purposes and by their organization, including how they use 
AI, the impact of AI use on work and jobs, their trust in AI for work 
purposes, and organizational support for responsible AI.
Specifically, employees were asked to report how often they 
intentionally use AI tools and systems in their work, clarifying 
that this use is different from the passive use of AI (such as 
when AI operates behind the scenes in tools such as email 
filters and search engines).

How is AI being used by employees at work?
The age of working with AI is here: 
3 in 5 employees report intentional 
regular use of AI at work
The rapid adoption of AI in the workplace, 
augmented by the release of generative AI 
tools such as ChatGPT, is evident. 
As shown in Figure 36, 77 percent of 
employees report that AI is being used by 
their organization. Almost half (47%) report 
their organization uses AI to a moderate to 
very large extent across a range of areas 
and tasks, and thirty percent report limited 
use in isolated areas or specific tasks. Just 
under one-quarter of employees report their 
organization does not use AI.
Fifty-eight percent of employees report 
intentionally using AI tools and systems in 
their work on a regular basis. Less than half 
of employees report any form of training or 
education in AI or related fields (47%) or have 
at least a moderate level of AI knowledge 
(46%), and only half (51%) believe they 
can use AI effectively. 
Figure 37 shows that frequency of use 
varies; about a third (31%) use AI on a 
weekly or daily basis, about a quarter (27%) 
use it semi-regularly (i.e. every month or 
few months) and two in five (42%) rarely 
or never use it.

The one-quarter (27%) of employees who 
never intentionally use AI at work were asked 
to indicate the reasons why. The top reasons 
included39:
•	 AI tools are not helpful, required or used for 
their work (58%)
•	 A preference to work without the involvement 
of AI tools (19%)
•	 Not understanding how to use AI tools (14%)
•	 AI tools are not approved or allowed (14%)
•	 Not trusting AI tools (12%)
•	 Lack of access or not wanting to pay for AI 
tools (12%)
In several advanced economies—notably the 
USA, Australia, Switzerland, Sweden, New 
Zealand, and the Netherlands—a lack of trust in 
AI tools was one of the top three reasons for 
not using AI (reported by 15-20%). Compared 
to those in emerging economies, employees 
working in advanced economies are more likely 
to say that they did not use AI tools because 
they are not helpful or required for their work. 
These findings provide insight into the potential 
barriers of AI adoption at work, reinforcing the 
importance of supporting AI literacy amongst 
employees, providing access to AI tools, and 
facilitating understanding of how AI can be used 
for a range of work applications to create value. 
It also highlights the importance of respecting 
employees’ choice about the use of these tools 
in their work.

Adoption of AI at work has increased 
dramatically since the release of ChatGPT
In the 17 countries surveyed in 2022 
and 2024, the proportion of employees 
reporting intentional use of AI for work 
purposes increased from just over half 
(54%) in 2022 to two thirds (67%) in 
2024 (see Figure 38). These figures 
reflect any use of AI for work purposes, 
including rare and occasional use.
Employee use of AI increased in all 
countries, with the largest increases 
occurring in the USA, Canada, the UK, 
and Australia (ranging from 34-37% 
in 2022 to 58-66% in 2024).
Similarly, the number of employees 
reporting organizational use of AI 
increased from 34 percent in 2022 to 
71 percent in 2024, with significant 
increases in all 17 countries. The largest 
increases were again in the USA, 
Canada, the UK, and Australia, together 
with France and Korea (ranging from 
20-24% in 2022 to 62-70% in 2024).

Most employees use free, public 
generative AI tools at work, yet only 
a minority report their organization 
has a policy governing its use
Employees that report using AI were asked to 
identify the main AI tools they use for work (see 
Figure 39). By far the most common tools—
used by almost three in four employees—are 
general-purpose generative AI tools, such as 
ChatGPT. Voice-based AI assistants, such as 
Siri and Google Assistant, are the next most 
common, used by just under half of employees, 
followed by image, video and audio generators. 
These high-use levels likely reflect the broad 
accessibility of these tools, including the ability 
to use these tools through a natural language 
interface, combined with their wide utility across a 
range of work tasks and functions, and immediate 
usability without AI training or education.
Comparatively fewer employees use AI tools with 
a more specialized focus or specific purpose—
such as Grammarly or predictive analytics 
tools—or AI systems developed or customized 
specifically for their organization. Even fewer 
use robots and physical autonomous systems.
Employees were also asked how they access 
these tools (see Figure 40). The majority (70%) 
say they use publicly available AI tools that are 
free to use, with a much lower proportion using 
public AI tools that require payment to access. 
Two in five report using AI tools that are provided 
or managed by their employer.

Despite the extensive use of generative AI 
tools in the workplace, employees report that 
limited policies are in place to guide and outline 
appropriate use. 
As shown in Figure 41, only two in five report 
that their organization has a policy or provides 
guidance on the use of generative AI tools 
at work. It is notable that almost one in five 
do not know if their organization has a policy, 
highlighting a significant gap between use and 
knowledge of workplace policies on generative 
AI tools.
Emerging economies are leading in 
workplace adoption of AI
As shown in Figure 42, more employees in 
emerging economies report using AI at work 
compared to those in advanced economies 
(72% vs. 49% using AI at least semi-regularly). 
Similarly, those working in emerging economies 
are more likely to report that their organization 
uses AI (81% vs. 66% in advanced economies) 
and does so more extensively (57% vs. 36% 
have moderate to extensive use).40

To illustrate, as shown in Figure 43, 80 percent 
or more employees report using AI at work on 
a regular basis in the emerging economies of 
India, China, Nigeria, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and 
Egypt. This compares to less than 50 percent 
in the majority of the advanced economies. 
We find an almost identical pattern of findings 
across countries for the organizational use 
of AI.41
A few countries with advanced economies 
deviate from this trend. Norway, Singapore, and 
Switzerland have comparatively high workplace 
adoption of AI compared to other advanced 
economies, with more than 60 percent of 
employees using AI at least every few months 
or more, and over 75 percent reporting that 
their organization uses AI. This likely reflects the 
previously reported high levels of AI training, 
literacy, trust and acceptance of AI amongst 
people in these countries compared to those in 
other advanced economy countries (see Figures 7 
and 13).
One in two employees trusts AI at work 
Respondents were asked how willing they are 
to trust AI systems for work purposes either 
by relying on the information and output AI 
provides to inform their work and decisions or in 
sharing relevant information and data to enable AI 
tools to perform tasks for them. 
About half (53%) report trusting AI tools for work 
purposes, which is similar to the proportion of 
employees that use AI on a regular basis (58%). 
There are clear differences among countries, 
ranging between 31 percent in Japan to 81 percent 
in India and Nigeria (see Figure 43). 
Trust is highest in the emerging economies, with 
an average of 63 percent of employees in these 
countries trusting AI for work, compared to an 
average of 45 percent in advanced economies. 
Employees’ trust in AI for work purposes is 
associated with their frequency of AI use at 
work (r=.46) and experiencing positive impacts 
of AI use at work (r=.53), highlighting the 
important role of trust in adoption. Trust in 
AI for work purposes is also associated with 
AI knowledge, efficacy, and AI training or 
education (r=.23-.45).

Trust of AI at work and perceived 
organizational support for responsible 
AI use has declined in many countries
Employees' increased adoption of AI 
has coincided with a trend of declining 
trust in its use for work purposes 
(2022: M=4.5 vs. 2024: M=4.3), with 
a meaningful decline in 10 of the 
17 countries. Brazil saw the largest 
decrease (77% vs. 56% trust, M=5.2 
vs. 4.7), together with Japan (43% 
vs. 27% trust, M=4.2 vs. 3.6).
Given the low adoption of AI at 
work in 2022, this likely reflects 
employees’ increased understanding 
of the capabilities and limitations 
of AI tools for work purposes. For 
example, as employees experience 
‘hallucinations’ and errors when using 
generative AI tools, this is likely to 
have prompted a healthy recalibration 
of expectations and trust of these 
tools. Indeed, as previously reported, 
inaccurate outcomes are a commonly 
experienced negative outcome when 
using AI systems.
At the same time, employees’ 
perceptions of organizational support 
and governance of responsible AI 
use also decreased in nine of the 
17 countries surveyed. The largest 
decrease occurred in Finland, falling 
from 52% in 2022 to 41% in 2024 
(M=4.6 vs. 3.8), together with 
Germany (M=4.4 vs. 3.8) and the 
Netherlands (M=4.2 vs. 3.7). 
Taken together, these trends suggest 
that the rapid adoption of AI at work 
has prompted a recalibration of 
employees’ trust in AI tools and an 
increased awareness of the need for 
organizational support and governance 
of responsible AI use.

Many employees are using AI in 
complacent and inappropriate ways, 
augmenting risks for both organizations 
and individuals 
A notable finding is the extent to which 
employees report using AI at work in complacent 
and inappropriate ways (see Figure 44).
Almost one in two employees who use AI admit 
to doing so in ways that contravene organizational 
policies and guidelines. For example, about half 
(48-49%) of employees report that they have 
uploaded sensitive company information, such 
as financial, sales, or customer information, or 
copyrighted material, into public AI tools. Such 
behaviors are most common of employees who 
report their organization has banned generative 
AI (67%) or has a policy guiding generative AI use 
(56%), compared to those in organizations without 
such policies (33%) or those who are unsure if 
there is a policy (38%). This suggests outright bans 
may be ineffective, and that simply having policies 
does not guarantee compliance; clear guidance 
and education on responsible AI use is needed.
Employees also report using AI in ethically 
ambiguous ways. Almost half (47%) say they 
have used AI in ways that could be considered 
inappropriate and even more indicate that they 
have seen or heard other employees using 
AI tools in inappropriate ways (63%). Fifty-six 
percent say they have used AI tools at work 
without knowing if it is allowed.
Over half (57%) of employees also admit that 
they have used AI in non-transparent ways, 
including presenting AI-generated content as 
their own or avoiding revealing when they have 
used AI tools to complete their work. This non-
transparent use makes it even more challenging 
for leaders and managers to govern and manage 
employees’ use of AI at work.
The complacent use of AI may also reduce the 
quality and accuracy of work. Over half (56%) 
report they have made mistakes in their work 
from AI use. This likely reflects using incorrect 
or ‘hallucinated’ AI-generated content from 
generative AI tools and may also include 
misinterpretation of AI recommendations or 
output. Two-thirds of employees report having 
relied on AI output at work without critically 
evaluating the information it provides (66%) and 
putting less effort into their work due to AI (72%). 
A contributing factor to this complacent use 
may be a sense of pressure to use AI tools, 
with almost half (48%) of employees feeling 
concerned about being left behind if they do 
not use AI at work. In support of this view, 
there is a positive association between the 
extent employees feel strain at work and their 
complacent use of AI (r=.31). 
While the survey was anonymous to encourage 
honest responses from the participants, these 
findings may underreport the actual extent of 
complacent and inappropriate use of AI in the 
workplace, given social desirability bias.42 
48%
of employees report 
that they have uploaded 
company information, 
such as financial, sales, 
or customer information, 
into public AI tools.

This inappropriate and complacent use of AI may 
in part reflect a lack of critical engagement in the 
way employees are using AI. As shown in Figure 
45, on average, only half of employees say they 
regularly engage critically with AI at work. Rather, 
most employees do not routinely evaluate the 
output of AI or consider the limitations of AI tools 
when making decisions based on its output, or 
the ethical implications of using AI content. Most 
employees infrequently reflect on whether they 
are using AI tools appropriately or weigh up the 
benefits and risks of using them.

Employees experience performance 
benefits from AI, but also mixed 
impacts on workload, stress, 
collaboration, compliance, and 
surveillance
Employees in organizations that use AI were 
asked how AI has impacted a range of work 
processes and outcomes. They report a 
range of beneficial impacts on performance, 
contrasted with other complex, mixed 
impacts which potentially augment risks 
for organizations and employees. 
Focusing on the beneficial impacts, as shown 
in Figure 46 (see blue bars), a majority of 
employees (54-67%) report that the use of AI 
tools in their workplace is delivering a range of 
benefits including increased levels of efficiency, 
improved access to accurate information, 
enhanced innovation and idea generation, 
higher work quality and decision-making, better 
use and development of skills and abilities, 
and improved knowledge sharing. Almost half 
(46%) report the use of AI tools has increased 
revenue generating activity in their organization. 
These findings highlight the significant 
performance benefits from AI. 
However, the positive benefits of using AI 
tools are not guaranteed. A quarter to a third 
of employees report that the use of AI tools at 
work has not had an impact on these desired 
outcomes. For example, a similar proportion 
of employees report AI has had no impact 
on revenue generation as those reporting an 
increase. Furthermore, about one in ten report 
that the use of AI has actually reduced some of 
these desired outcomes. Whether or not AI use 
delivers beneficial outcomes is likely dependent 
on a combination of factors, including the 
nature of the work, the purpose and types 
of AI tools used, how AI is implemented and 
integrated into work design and organizational 
strategy, and the level of employees’ AI literacy 
and capabilities.
Employees also report that the use of AI is 
having mixed impacts on workload, time spent 
on repetitive tasks, and stress and pressure at 
work (see Figure 46). While about two in five 
(36-40%) employees have experienced positive 
reductions, between one-quarter and two-
fifths (26-39%) report increases in workload, 
repetition, stress and pressure from using AI 
tools. This is not surprising given the evidence 
that technological advancements can result 
in the intensification of work, highlighting the 
need for appropriate work redesign and change 
management.43 
AI training (r=.24), knowledge (r=.42), efficacy 
(r=.41), and perceptions of organizational 
support for AI and responsible use (r=.56) 
are positively associated with experiencing 
beneficial impacts of AI use at work. 
What are the impacts of AI use at work?

AI use is also having mixed impacts on workplace 
communication and collaboration. While about 
two in five report that AI tools have increased 
communication and collaboration, close to a fifth 
report that AI use has reduced it. 
A third (35%) of employees report that the use of 
AI tools has resulted in increased compliance and 
privacy risks, such as contravening rules, policies 
and local laws. Since most employees report 
using free, publicly available generative AI tools, 
this may result in instances of uploading private, 
confidential or copyrighted material into public 
AI systems. One fifth of employees say using 
AI tools helps reduce compliance and privacy 
risks, which may reflect the growing use of AI for 
monitoring and managing cybersecurity threats 
as well as ensuring employee compliance with 
organizational policies. 
It is also notable that two in five report increased 
monitoring and surveillance of employees using AI 
technologies. This increase may have implications 
for trust in the workplace: while in some work 
contexts, monitoring and surveillance is required 
and beneficial for ensuring safe and trustworthy 
conduct and adherence to laws and governance 
policies, these control mechanisms can contribute 
to decreased levels of trust at work if perceived as 
signaling management distrust of employees.44
Most employees report that AI use in their 
workplace has either had no impact on job security 
or has increased it, with just under one in five 
reporting it had reduced job security. 
This complex mix of impacts underscores the 
importance of understanding, managing and 
monitoring the implementation, use and impacts 
of AI at work, investing in appropriate work 
redesign, and building employee capabilities to 
support effective and balanced levels of human-
AI collaboration.

The adoption of AI has changed how and 
by whom work is done with employees 
rapidly becoming dependent on AI and 
human-AI collaboration
The data suggests that about half of employees 
rely heavily on AI tools and collaboration with AI 
to perform their work, with two in five employees 
indicating that they sometimes or often cannot 
complete work without the help of AI (see Figure 
47). This reliance is likely to increase over time 
given that half of employees say they regularly 
rely on AI to perform tasks rather than learning 
the skills to do so themselves. 
These findings underscore the risk of employee 
skill degradation over time and align with our 
finding that deskilling and dependency on AI 
are key societal concerns and notable negative 
outcomes of AI adoption. This reinforces the need 
for thoughtful work design to ensure AI empowers 
humans to retain critical skills as well as focus 
on higher-skilled, meaningful work.
Our findings also reveal that about half of 
employees surveyed regularly choose to use AI to 
complete work, rather than collaborating with peers 
or supervisors. This has implications for achieving a 
diversity of inputs, as well as the development and 
retention of collaborative capabilities and processes 
in the workplace. It also highlights concerns about 
diminishing human interactions and connections 
from increased reliance on AI tools (previously 
reported in Figure 20). 
Most prefer AI involvement in managerial 
decision-making with human oversight
Further evidence of employees’ support for 
human-AI collaboration comes from their views 
of the use of AI in managerial decision-making. 
Respondents were asked to choose the most 
acceptable weighting between human and AI 
involvement in decision-making related to work 
and resource allocation, hiring, promotions, and 
pay rises.45
As shown in Figure 48, most believe that AI 
should aid managerial decision-making, but 
want humans to retain most or equal control. 
Nearly half consider a 75 percent human and 
25 percent AI decision-making split to be the 
most acceptable balance. The next most popular 
preference is an even 50/50 split, supported by 
just under a third of respondents.
Only ten percent believe AI should dominate 
managerial decision-making, and even fewer 
support a fully AI-driven approach where there is 
no human involvement. This highlights the lack of 
support for fully automated managerial decision-
making or AI taking precedence over humans in 
important workplace decisions.

Organizational support for AI and 
its responsible use is lagging behind 
adoption, particularly in advanced 
economies
The extent of complacent and inappropriate use of 
AI within the workplace highlights the importance 
of organizational support and governance of 
responsible AI use. Employees in organizations 
that are actively using AI, were asked whether 
their organization: a) has an AI strategy and culture, 
b) supports AI literacy and responsible use by 
employees, and c) has responsible AI governance 
practices in place, such as regular monitoring of AI 
systems, accountability systems to oversee AI use, 
and data privacy and security measures.
We find substantial variation between advanced 
and emerging economies (see Figure 49). 
In advanced economies, just over half of 
employees report that their organization has 
mechanisms in place to support AI adoption and 
responsible use, including a strategy and culture 
conducive to responsible AI adoption, adequate 
employee training, and governance processes. 
Only 55 percent believe there are adequate 
safeguards within their organization to ensure 
responsible AI use. While these findings are 
based on employee perceptions and awareness 
of these organizational support mechanisms, 
they suggest that just under half of organizations 
in advanced economies may be using AI without 
adequate support and governance.
In contrast, in emerging economies, about 
70 percent say their organization has a clear 
AI strategy, offers responsible AI training, 
and 65 percent report AI governance policies. 
Furthermore, 71 percent feel assured that 
sufficient safeguards exist for responsible AI 
use. This higher level of organizational support 
for AI aligns with the greater reported employee 
use of AI and higher levels of AI education and 
training, AI knowledge, and efficacy reported in 
emerging economies.
These findings are based on employees who report 
working in organizations that are actively using AI. 
We anticipate considerably lower organizational 
support for responsible AI in organizations that are 
considering but have not yet actively taken steps 
to integrate AI into their operations. 
Only
55%
of employees in advanced 
economies feel there are 
adequate safeguards within 
their organization to ensure 
responsible AI use. 
This suggests 
that just under
half
of organizations in advanced 
economies may be using AI 
without adequate support 
and governance.

Country-level data further illustrate these 
differences (see Figure 50).
Over 70 percent of employees in India, 
Nigeria, Egypt, China, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, 
Türkiye, South Africa, and Brazil report strong 
organizational support for responsible AI. Among 
advanced economies, Singapore, Switzerland, 
the UK, Norway, Italy, and Denmark lead, with at 
least 60 percent of employees reporting robust 
organizational support. In contrast, employees 
in Portugal, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and 
Finland report some of the lowest levels of 
organizational support.

AI’s impact on work and jobs: Only one 
in three believe AI will create more jobs 
than it will eliminate 
Employees are conscious of the potential impact 
of AI on work and jobs (see Figure 51). Over half 
agree that the way they do their daily work will 
change because of AI. 
In terms of job impacts, less than a third believe 
AI will create more jobs than it will eliminate. 
Rather, almost half believe the opposite—that 
AI will eliminate more jobs than it will create. 
This aligns with our earlier-reported finding that 
the potential for job losses from AI technology 
implementation is a key societal concern and is 
experienced or observed by two in five people.46 
Employees are split in their views on whether 
AI can perform key aspects of their work and 
will replace jobs in their specific area of work. 
This likely reflects the diverse range of jobs, 
occupations and industries represented in the 
survey sample, and the extent to which AI 
systems and capabilities are useful in these jobs. 
Our earlier finding that one in five employees 
report reduced job security from the use of AI 
suggests that a minority are directly experiencing 
AI-related job insecurity.
People in emerging economies are more optimistic 
about job creation from AI, with 39 percent 
agreeing AI will create more jobs than it will 
eliminate, compared to 23 percent of those in 
advanced economies. This is not blind optimism. 
Employees in emerging economies are also more 
likely than those in advanced economies to agree 
that key aspects of their work could be performed 
by AI (53% vs. 35%), how they do their work will 
change due to AI (64% vs. 48%), and more are 
concerned about being left behind if they don’t 
use AI (56% vs. 42%).
We next examine what encourages employee 
use of AI at work, and, importantly, what predicts 
critical engagement with AI tools.

What predicts the use and critical 
engagement of AI at work? 
The findings on employee use of AI highlights 
that organizations must navigate a complex 
balance between promoting AI adoption to realize 
the benefits, while simultaneously encouraging 
thoughtful, critical engagement with AI tools that 
underpins responsible use.
To help inform how this balance can be achieved, 
we conducted statistical modelling to identify the 
key predictors of AI use and critical engagement 
with AI at work, using the same techniques 
explained in the section ‘What are the key drivers 
of trust and acceptance of AI systems?’
These combined results highlight that AI literacy 
is a key lever, as the strongest predictor of both 
AI use and critical engagement. Experiencing 
positive performance benefits from AI also 
motivates both use and critical engagement. 
In contrast, experiencing negative impacts from 
AI reduces adoption but can prompt employees 
to adopt a more critical and discerning stance.
Our findings show that trust in AI systems 
encourages employee adoption, but its negative 
impact on critical engagement highlights the 
The predictors examined align with the four 
pathways discussed earlier: AI literacy (knowledge 
pathway), perceived performance benefits of AI at 
work (motivation), perceived negative impacts of 
AI use (uncertainty), and organizational support for 
AI, AI literacy, as well as responsible AI governance 
(institutional pathway). Additionally, the impact of 
trust in AI at work was examined. These models 
were tested using data from employees in 
organizations that use AI.
Our analysis revealed that each of the four 
pathways predicts both the frequency of AI use 
at work and critical engagement with AI, but in 
different ways.
need for organizations to avoid fostering blind, 
uncritical trust in AI tools. Instead, employees 
should be supported to calibrate their trust based 
on the technology’s trustworthiness and reliability. 
Cultivating an AI-friendly culture and strategy can 
help to encourage employees to use AI more 
frequently, whereas responsible AI governance 
mechanisms help to prompt deeper critical 
reflection when using AI tools. We explore the 
implications of these findings further in the 
Conclusions and Implications section.

Employees who are younger, AI trained, 
university-educated, higher-income 
earners and managers are more likely 
to use and trust AI at work and believe 
AI will change aspects of their work
As shown in Figure 52, younger people (aged 
under 35), those with AI training, university-
education, or higher incomes, and managers 
are more likely to use AI for work purposes and 
to trust AI in the workplace. These groups are 
also more likely to report that their organization 
uses AI, fosters an AI-driven culture, and 
supports responsible AI use. The largest 
differences are seen in relation to AI training 
and income.
This pattern mirrors our previously reported 
findings that these groups are more trusting 
and accepting of AI use in society and have 
higher levels of AI literacy, (see Figures 33-35).
These groups are also more likely to agree 
that AI will perform key aspects of their job 
and agree that AI will change the way they do 
their daily work (67% AI trained vs. 43% no 
AI training; 62% university educated vs. 44% 
no university education; 41% managers vs. 
21%-29% other occupations). Managers and 
high-income earners are also more likely to 
agree that AI will create more jobs than it will 
eliminate (65% managers vs. 36-56% other 
occupations; 54% high-income vs. 26% and 
17% of middle- and low-income respondents, 
respectively). 
Taken together, these findings suggest that 
these groups are better positioned to integrate AI 
into their work and realize performance benefits 
(see below). Conversely, employees without 
these attributes—namely older, lower-income 
employees, those without AI training or university 
education—may be at risk of being left behind 
and experience what has been called ‘AI divide’ in 
terms of progression, opportunities and benefits. 
High-income earners, those with AI 
training and managers report the most 
positive impacts from AI at work
As shown in Figure 53, higher-income earners, 
those with AI training, and people in managerial 
positions are more likely to report experiencing 
positive impacts from AI at work compared to 
middle- and low-income earners, employees 
without AI training and those in non-managerial 
occupations.
To illustrate specific positive impacts, high-
income earners are more likely to have 
experienced increased quality or accuracy of 
work (72%) compared to middle- (54%) and low-
income respondents (44%). Those with AI training 
and managers are more likely to report increased 
efficiency due to AI (76% vs. 56% without AI 
training; 75% of managers vs. 55-67% in other 
occupations) and increased revenue-generating 
activity from AI (55% vs. 34% without AI training; 
59% of managers compared to 40-43% in other 
occupations). 
How do demographic factors influence 
use and perceptions of AI at work?
There are notable differences between subgroups of employees in their 
use, trust, perceptions and realized benefits from AI use in the workplace, 
all of which have implications for the management of AI. We note at the 
outset that there are no gender differences in AI use or attitudes toward 
AI at work.

Younger employees, those with 
AI training, and those with higher 
incomes are more likely to engage in 
inappropriate and complacent use of 
AI at work 
It is notable that some of these groups are also 
the most likely to use AI inappropriately. After 
accounting for frequency of AI use at work in 
analyses,48 younger employees, those with AI 
training, and higher-income earners are more 
likely to use AI in their work in inappropriate or 
complacent ways. 
As shown in Figure 53, 65 percent of younger 
employees (aged under 35) report engaging in 
complacent and inappropriate use behaviors, 
compared to half or fewer of older employees 
([effect size] n²=.04).49 Similarly, employees with 
AI education or training report higher rates of 
complacent and inappropriate use (63% vs. 
46%; n²=.03), though they are also more likely 
to engage critically with AI in their work (53% vs. 
40% most of the time or always; n²=.03).
Income also plays a role, with higher-income 
earners (70%) being the most likely to report 
complacent or inappropriate AI use. Notably, they 
are also more likely to engage in AI behaviors that 
contravene AI policies than other income groups 
(n²=.03).
While frequency of use explains some of the 
variation in inappropriate and complacent use, 
it does not fully account for the observed 
differences in these groups. Other underlying 
factors such as understanding of AI, workplace 
norms, or training, may shape how AI systems 
are being used. For example, these groups may 
have developed ways of using and relying on AI 
in their work before guidelines were established, 
leading to the formation of unhealthy complacent 
norms. The higher trust levels in AI among these 
groups may also influence them to over-trust 
and rely on these technologies more than other 
groups. In addition, these groups may feel that 
their heightened understanding of AI or seniority 
gives them license to decide how best to use AI.
Employees working in the IT, finance 
and insurance, and media and 
communications sectors report the 
highest AI adoption and those in 
government and public administration 
report the lowest adoption 
We sampled employees in each of the 18 
sectors shown in Figure 54.50 Sampling was 
naturally occurring rather than representative of 
each industry and ranged from 527 employees 
in the real estate industry to 3,415 employees 
in the manufacturing sector and are based on 
employee perceptions and experiences. As such, 
the findings should be interpreted as indicative 
of broad trends. 
Our analysis revealed statistically significant 
differences between industries on a range of 
indicators, most notably:
•	 Employees in the Information Technology (IT), 
Media and Communications, and Financial and 
Insurance sectors report the highest use of AI 
at work (72-85%, see Figure 54) and greatest 
organizational adoption of AI (90-94%). 
•	 Employees in the IT and Financial and 
Insurance sectors also report the greatest 
organizational support for AI (75-76%), trust 
in the use of AI at work (62-67%), beneficial 
impacts from AI use (63-66%), and job impacts 
from AI (68-72%). 
•	 In contrast, employees in the Government and 
Public Administration, Healthcare and Social 
Assistance, and Transport and Logistics sectors 
report the lowest employee adoption of AI 
(43-47%), organizational adoption (61-63%), 
organizational support for AI and its responsible 
use (55-60%), and the least beneficial impacts 
from AI (48-52%). 
•	 Employees in the Arts, Entertainment and 
Recreation Services and Healthcare and Social 
Assistance sectors report the lowest trust in 
AI at work (46-48%) and are the least likely to 
believe that AI can perform key aspects of their 
work (33-35% agree).
•	 After accounting for frequency of use in 
analyses, there are no differences in complacent 
or inappropriate use between industries.

In summary
Taken together, these findings reveal a complex and nuanced picture of AI 
use in the workplace. A majority of employees are intentionally using AI 
at work, and experiencing positive impacts, particularly performance and 
efficiency benefits. However, there are mixed effects from AI integration, 
particularly on workload, stress, and collaboration. Many employees are 
using AI in ways that are inappropriate or complacent, with organizational 
support and governance for responsible AI use perceived to be lagging, 
particularly in advanced economies. These factors, combined with the 
insight that most employees use free, publicly available generative AI tools 
in organizations that lack clear policies on its use, opens up substantial 
organizational risk. While most employees trust AI at work and accept its 
involvement in managerial decision-making, rapid adoption is reshaping 
workflows and deepening dependency on human-AI collaboration.
In the final empirical section, we examine AI use by students who represent 
the workforce of the future.

Student attitudes 
towards AI in 
education
SECTION THREE
Respondents who were currently studying were asked about the 
intentional use of AI in their studies, the types of AI tools they 
use, if their education providers support responsible AI use, and 
the impact of AI use in education.
The majority of students were enrolled in university education 
(65%) or a vocational, trade or technical program (16%), with 
the remainder in secondary education (18%; see Appendix 2 
for sample details).

How is AI being used by students?
Four in five students regularly use AI in 
their studies
Most students (83%) use AI in their studies 
on a regular basis, with half using it weekly or 
daily. Eighty-three percent of students also use 
AI for personal, non-study-related purposes at 
least semi-regularly.
Students are more likely to use AI in their 
studies than employees are in their work (83% 
vs. 58% use AI regularly or semi-regularly; see 
Figure 55).
About half of students (53%) report trusting AI 
tools in their studies, which mirrors the finding 
for employees (52% trust).
While about half (53%) report receiving AI 
education or training, 72 percent indicate that 
they have at least moderate knowledge about 
AI and feel they can use AI tools effectively. 
Collectively, these results suggest most 
students feel confident in their knowledge 
and ability to use AI systems.
Of the few students who do not use AI in their 
studies (8%, n=195), the most common reasons 
are that they prefer to do their work without AI 
(55%), followed by the belief that AI tools are 
not helpful or required (34%), and that AI will 
have a negative impact on their learning (31%).
Freely available general-purpose 
generative AI tools are most used 
by students
Mirroring the pattern for employees, students 
are most likely to use general-purpose 
generative AI tools (89%) and voice-based 
AI assistants (42%) in their studies, (see 
Figure 56), and are much more likely to use 
free, publicly available tools (89%) than tools 
provided by their education provider (26%), or 
those that require payment to access (12%).

Many students use AI inappropriately 
or complacently
Only half of students (52%) who use AI in their 
studies critically engage with it on a regular basis, 
for example by evaluating AI output or verifying 
its accuracy before using it, and considering the 
limitations of an AI tool when making decisions 
based on its output. Rather, many students report 
using AI in complacent or inappropriate ways 
(see Figure 57). 
Almost three in five (59%) students report 
having used AI in ways that contravene their 
education provider’s policies or guidance. 
Over half (56%) say they have used AI tools 
in ways that could be considered inappropriate, 
and 84 percent state that they have seen 
or heard of other students using AI tools in 
inappropriate ways.
Most report using AI in ethically ambiguous and 
non-transparent ways, such as using AI tools 
without knowing whether it is allowed, avoiding 
revealing when they have used AI tools in their 
coursework, and presenting AI-generated content 
as their own.
The findings also suggest that students are 
becoming increasingly dependent and over-reliant 
on AI tools in their studies, with implications for 
learning. Over three quarters say they have relied 
on AI to complete tasks rather than learning how 
to do them themselves, or felt unable to complete 
their coursework without its help (see Figure 57). 
Eighty-one percent say they have put less effort 
into their studies or assessment knowing they can 
rely on AI, and two-thirds have made mistakes in 
their work due to AI.
One potential contributor to the inappropriate 
and complacent use of AI may be a sense of 
competitive pressure to use AI tools, with half of 
students indicating they are concerned about being 
left behind if they don’t use AI tools in their studies. 
Such competitive pressure could lead to increased 
use and greater dependence on AI, potentially 
cascading into complacent use.
Students are more likely to report inappropriate 
or complacent AI use and over-reliance on AI in 
their studies than employees are in their work. 
For example, around three quarters (76%) of 
student AI users say they have relied on AI output 
without evaluating the information or felt unable to 
complete their work without AI (77%), compared 
to two thirds (66%) of employees.

Students experience positive impacts 
of AI use in education, but AI’s influence 
on social dynamics, critical thinking, 
and fairness and equity is mixed
Figure 58 shows the impacts of AI use in 
education. The purple bars show a positive impact, 
for example by increasing efficiency and decreasing 
stress and pressure. The blue bars indicate a 
negative impact, for example by reducing critical 
thinking and increasing time on mundane tasks. 
As shown in this figure (see purple bars), the 
majority of students report notable positive impacts 
from the use of AI in their education, including 
increased efficiency, quality and accuracy of 
work, idea generation and innovation, and the 
personalization of learning. Over half also report 
reduced workload and stress and pressure.
However, there are also mixed impacts. A quarter 
to a third of students (27-36%) report the use 
of AI in education has reduced critical thinking, 
as well as communication, interaction, and 
collaboration with instructors and peers, trust 
of students by instructors and peers, and the 
fairness and equity of assessments, while similar 
proportions report AI has had a positive impact 
on these outcomes. There are also mixed impacts 
on skill development and time spent on mundane 
tasks, with almost half of students reporting 
positive impacts and a quarter to a third reporting 
negative impacts.
These findings suggest that while AI can offer 
substantial advantages—particularly for completing 
tasks—AI use may also inadvertently hinder key 
essential interpersonal and cognitive skills, and as 
well documented, raise challenges for the fairness 
and equity of assessment. 
Students’ perceptions of the impacts of AI 
on jobs and the world of work broadly mirror 
those reported for employees. Fewer than one 
in three believe AI will create more jobs than 
it will eliminate, with almost half disagreeing.

Support for responsible AI use in 
education is lagging adoption: only half of 
students report their education provider 
has a policy guiding generative AI use
Despite the pervasive use of AI by students, only 
half of the students surveyed (49%) believe their 
education provider has appropriate safeguards in 
place to make them feel comfortable with the use 
of AI in learning and teaching.
Only half report their education provider supports 
responsible AI use by having policies in place to 
ensure equitable use in learning and assessment 
and providing students access to training and 
resources on responsible use (see Figure 59). 
This low investment may reflect that only half 
of students report that their education provider 
encourages students to use AI in their learning 
and supports them to innovate with AI. 
Given the high use of generative AI by students, 
it is notable that less than a third report that 
their education provider has a policy in place to 
guide the responsible use of generative AI by 
students, and one in five indicate that there are 
policies banning generative AI use (see Figure 
60). A quarter of students do not know if there is 
a policy in place, suggesting a lack of awareness 
may be contributing to complacent use.
These student-reported insights suggest many 
education providers are not adequately supporting 
students in the responsible use of AI or are not 
making students sufficiently aware of relevant 
policy, training and resources.

In summary
These findings highlight that while most students are using and benefiting from 
AI, the complacent and inappropriate use of AI in education is widespread, and 
students are experiencing mixed impacts from AI use. Furthermore, education 
providers appear to be lagging in providing adequate training, resources and 
policy guidance to support and enforce the responsible use of AI by students. 
These findings have implications for the effective development of critical skills 
and the integrity of assessment in the AI age, and the future of work, as these 
students become the workforce of the future. 
We next discuss the implications of these findings and the broader 
research insights.

Conclusion and 
implications
Underlying this ambivalence is the tension between realizing the benefits of AI and ensuring its 
responsible use. This tension is evident at multiple levels: 
•	 At the societal level, governments seek to realize the national economic and productivity gains from 
AI and harness its potential to transform social services and address societal challenges, whilst also 
exercising their responsibility to protect societal values and safeguard citizens from harm and unfair 
treatment. Some jurisdictions view ongoing and significant investment in responsible AI as key to 
fostering competitive advantage.52
•	 Citizens want to benefit from the promise of AI, while feeling safe and avoiding manipulation, fraud, 
privacy and IP loss, bias, and the damaging societal consequences of prolific mis- and disinformation. 
•	 At the organizational level, leaders seek to realize enhanced productivity, innovation, value creation 
and competitive advantage from AI, whilst mitigating material and reputational risks and building 
sustained stakeholder trust.
•	 At the individual level, employees and students seek to enhance efficiency, quality and creativity 
in work and study, while avoiding deskilling, loss of jobs and the erosion of meaningful human 
connection. Some feel they have little choice but to adopt AI, fearing that not using it risks them 
becoming uncompetitive and left behind.
The research insights from this global survey highlight the current and future opportunities 
and challenges of responsibly stewarding AI into work, education, and society.
Our findings reveal rapid adoption of AI despite substantial public ambivalence toward its 
use. Although a clear majority recognize the technical competence, utility, and benefits 
of AI, fewer are assured of its safety and security, and many are concerned about the 
societal impacts. This ambivalence manifests in the cautious acceptance of AI coupled 
with limited trust, and optimism about its benefits coupled with worry about the risks.51 
This tension helps explain why the pace of AI 
adoption in the quest for performance gains has 
often outstripped AI literacy, training, governance, 
and regulation. It is also why there is a public 
mandate for stronger regulation and governance 
of AI, and growing desire for assurance of its 
trustworthy use. 
Effectively navigating this tension is one of the 
grand challenges of our time53 and will require 
proactive and sustained action and effort from 
multiple actors at all levels. 
To help address this challenge, we draw out the 
insights and implications of the research for key 
groups at the forefront of AI adoption, integration, 
governance and regulation. These include 
government policymakers, regulators and citizens; 
organizational leaders, managers and employees; 
and education providers and students.

Emerging economies are leading 
in public and employee AI adoption, 
trust, acceptance and realized benefits
A key insight is the notable difference in adoption 
and sentiment toward AI between countries with 
emerging and advanced economies. People in 
emerging economies report accelerated adoption 
and a pattern of greater trust, acceptance, and 
positive attitudes toward AI. They also self-
report higher levels of AI literacy and training, 
realized benefits both in work and society, 
and organizational support and governance for 
responsible AI use.54 This pattern is particularly 
strong in countries such as India, China, Nigeria, 
Egypt and the UAE.
This pattern may be due to the increasingly 
important role that transformative technologies 
play in the economic development of these 
countries55 and the greater relative benefits and 
opportunities AI affords people in emerging 
economies.56 For example, AI systems may 
help fill critical resource gaps in these countries 
by enabling access to quality information and 
services where access is limited. 
AI may provide augmented opportunities for 
people and organizations in emerging economies 
to overcome economic disadvantage and barriers. 
By bridging gaps in language, skills, information 
or networks, people in these countries may 
enhance their competitiveness and be able to 
seize a broader range of work and economic 
opportunities, including access to global markets. 
This potential may encourage a growth mindset that 
motivates trust, acceptance, and use of technology 
as a means to accelerate economic progress, 
prosperity, and quality of life. It may also motivate 
investment in AI training and literacy as a foundation 
for realizing and augmenting the benefits.
The greater levels of trust and acceptance seen 
in emerging economies can be explained, in part, 
by the pathways in our model. Higher levels of AI 
literacy (knowledge pathway), greater perceived 
and experienced benefits (motivational), and more 
favorable views of the adequacy of regulation 
and confidence in industry to develop and use AI 
responsibly (institutional) help to reduce concerns 
about risks (uncertainty pathway) and shape the 
view that benefits outweigh risks.
Similar pathways also help to explain why 
emerging economies are leading in AI workplace 
adoption and trust at work, with employees 
reporting more beneficial outcomes from 
organizational AI use, as well as higher levels 
of AI training and literacy and more perceived 
organizational support for responsible use, which 
helps mitigate risks and uncertainty.
These insights raise the question of whether 
governments and organizations operating in 
advanced economies need to augment investment 
and support in AI training and literacy, as well as 
strategic use and governance of AI to help realize 
benefits and support adoption.
Looking ahead, the nations that accelerate 
in responsible adoption may be uniquely 
positioned to gain long-term competitive and 
strategic advantage if AI becomes a central 
driver of productivity, innovation, and progress 
on societal challenges, such as climate change. 
This potential advantage, combined with the 
increasing importance of AI for national security, 
could prompt new dynamics in international 
relations, including debates around access to 
AI technologies and whether restrictions might 
emerge in response to perceived strategic or 
economic gains. 
While a challenge to AI adoption, we caution 
against viewing the lower trust and acceptance 
in advanced economies as a deficit. Rather it can 
be viewed as appropriate rational caution based 
on the perceived state of AI use in society, the 
current levels of governance, regulation and 
standards supporting it, coupled with low levels 
of AI literacy. Well-placed trust in AI systems is 
grounded in informed and accurate assessments 
of their benefits, limitations, and safeguards. 
Interventions to strengthen trust and acceptance 
can focus on enhancing the adequacy of regulation 
and investing in initiatives to mitigate negative 
outcomes from AI use, designing and deploying 
AI systems to maximize beneficial outcomes and 
reduce risks (e.g. privacy by design), strengthening 
organizational assurances and governance of 
trustworthy use, and systematically improving AI 
literacy, through public and employee AI education 
programs, for example.
Our findings further suggest the high trust 
and acceptance levels in emerging economies 
are not based on blind optimism: people in 
these economies perceive and experience 
negative outcomes of AI in a similar way to 
those in advanced economies. Rather, they 
experience augmented benefits, which offset 
these risks. However, it is important to guard 
against overconfidence and complacency that 
can stem from high trust by encouraging critical 
engagement, for example.

While there is a distinct pattern between advanced 
and emerging economies, it is important to 
recognize that countries within these broad 
categories vary substantially in their economic, 
cultural, political, and historical contexts, and there 
are country exceptions that don’t fall neatly into 
these patterns.
There is a public mandate for AI 
regulation with the current regulatory 
landscape falling short of expectations: 
implications for policymakers
The 47 countries surveyed represent a variety 
of approaches and stages in AI regulation and 
governance.
At the time of data collection, countries such as 
Singapore and China stood out for the breadth 
of regulatory and governance measures that 
had been implemented. Other jurisdictions, 
such as the European Union and Korea, had 
designed comprehensive AI laws and regulatory 
frameworks and were in the process of 
implementation. Countries such as Australia, 
India, and Canada were debating proposed AI-
specific legislative frameworks. Similarly, a range 
of countries—including emerging economies 
such as Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, and the UAE—had 
implemented or proposed AI guidelines without 
adopting comprehensive legislation. The UK 
and the USA (including individual US states) 
had launched multiple initiatives but lacked a 
unified regulatory approach. Notably, after data 
collection, the US Government scaled back its 
approach to AI regulation, and while 58 countries 
signed the Paris AI Action Summit agreement, 
the USA and UK did not.57
In the context of this lack of a globally 
consistent regulatory approach, our findings 
provide important insights and evidence on 
public expectations surrounding the regulatory 
landscape for AI. 
They reveal a clear public mandate for robust, fit-
for-purpose AI regulation underpinned by globally 
shared concerns surrounding the societal risks 
and negative outcomes from AI, and low public 
trust in the safety and security of AI use. 
The majority of people in all countries expect a 
multipronged regulatory approach, supporting 
both international and national laws and 
regulation, and expecting government and existing 
regulators to play a leading role. They also expect 
industry to be involved, working together with 
government and regulatory bodies through co-
regulation, and aligning organizational governance. 
The near universal endorsement and preference 
for international-level laws and regulation 
indicates public recognition that AI is not bound 
by national borders and is often developed by 
multinational companies who operate cross-
border, which can constrain the ability of a 
national government or regulatory body to 
develop and enforce regulation. International 
standards (e.g. from the International Standards 
Organization [ISO]) can provide governments 
and industry with interoperable frameworks for 
regulation and governance. 
In contrast to these expectations, the majority 
view the current regulatory landscape as 
inadequate and falling short in making AI use safe.
This gap between public expectations and the 
current regulatory landscape likely reflects 
the early stage of regulatory design and 
implementation in many jurisdictions. It may also 
partly reflect low public awareness of existing 
applicable laws in countries where these exist. 
To consider and remedy this gap, policymakers 
need to not only design, implement and enforce 
appropriate AI regulation, but also to educate 
and raise public awareness of these laws. This 
includes clarifying and raising awareness of how 
existing laws (e.g. privacy and consumer laws) 
apply to AI in countries where these are in place, 
and the rights and responsibilities that each 
individual has, as well as the responsibilities of 
organizations and governments to manage and 
enforce the laws.58 For example, some people 
may not know that under the EU AI Act they have 
a right to know when they are interacting with 
certain AI applications (e.g. chatbots). 
When people believe there are adequate 
regulatory safeguards, they are considerably 
more likely to trust and accept the use of AI, 
underscoring the importance of having an 
effective regulatory framework in place and 
ensuring it is communicated widely to those that 
are governed by it. A clear and effective regulatory 
framework and coordinated international 
responses provides industry with certainty 
and supports sustained safe use and adoption, 
as well as interoperability across countries.

Our findings reinforce that AI-generated 
misinformation is a key concern globally59 and is 
undermining trust in online content and raising 
concerns about the integrity of elections. There 
is strong public support for legislative measures 
to combat AI-generated misinformation, with the 
public also expecting media and social media 
companies to implement stronger fact-checking 
and techniques to enable the detection of AI-
generated content (e.g. watermarking). These 
expectations stand in contrast with moves by 
some social media companies to reduce fact-
checking on their platforms.60
Combatting misinformation and supporting 
the public’s ability to detect content generated 
and spread by AI bots is critical to supporting 
well-functioning democratic processes and 
societal cohesion. The widespread adoption of 
increasingly sophisticated generative AI tools is 
likely to make fake content easier to produce and 
disseminate, yet harder to detect.
The age of working with AI is here: 
implications for organizational leaders 
and employees
Our findings indicate that the age of working 
with AI is here, with high rates of self-reported 
employee and organizational adoption particularly in 
emerging economies, and a preference for human-
AI collaboration in managerial decision making.
The use of AI at work is delivering clear 
performance-related benefits ranging from 
productivity gains, better resource utilization, 
greater access to information, enhanced 
innovation and knowledge sharing, and increased 
revenue-generation opportunities. These benefits 
are indicators of the return on investment that 
can be realized from adopting AI technology.
However, our research indicates that these 
benefits are not guaranteed and are often 
accompanied by a concerning pattern of 
complacent, inappropriate, and non-transparent 
use of AI by employees, which augment 
material and reputational risks for organizations, 
leaders, and employees alike. Compounding 
this complacent use is lagging organizational 
governance and support for responsible AI use.61
For example, while most employees are using 
public generative AI tools, many organizations do 
not provide any policy to guide their use, despite 
the risks these public tools pose for privacy 
Key considerations for policymakers 
and regulators
•	 Analyze gaps in current regulation 
and laws.
•	 Accelerate the development and 
implementation of effective and 
enforceable AI regulation at the national 
and international level. 
•	 Collaborate with trusted technical experts 
to ensure regulation is effective and 
enforceable.
•	 Support international coordination and 
cooperation to ensure consistent global 
standards, interoperability, and mitigation 
of AI risks.
•	 Communicate and raise public 
awareness of legal rights, protections and 
responsibilities that relate to common 
applications of AI.
•	 Invest in public AI training and education to 
support AI literacy and responsible use.
•	 Invest in methods to combat mis- and 
disinformation.
Key actions for media and social 
media companies
•	 Invest in fact-checking and other 
mechanisms to combat mis- and 
disinformation.
•	 Develop and use tools that enable and 
support users to identify AI-generated 
content.
and data leakage, loss of IP, and cybersecurity 
concerns. Even when policies are in place, a 
worrying number of employees say they are 
using these tools in ways that contravene 
policies and rules, put company and customer 
data at risk, and raise quality issues. The invisible 
nature of much of employees’ individual AI work 
practices limits the ability to understand and 
harness the benefits and manage the risks. 
While many organizations are still at an early 
stage of their journey with AI62, these findings 
suggest a significant gap between employee 
individual adoption and organizational awareness 
and preparedness. There is an urgent imperative 
to close this gap.

Our research suggests that organizations can 
encourage AI adoption, while simultaneously 
promoting critical engagement with AI tools 
to combat complacent use, by cultivating an AI 
strategy and culture, implementing responsible 
AI governance mechanisms, and supporting 
employee AI training, literacy and understanding 
of AI capabilities, limitations and standards of 
responsible use. Each element is critical: the 
benefits of AI adoption and integration are more 
likely to be realized when organizations have each 
of these strategic, cultural, governance and training 
mechanisms in place.
There are many resources to help organizations 
support the development and implementation of 
robust AI governance systems, including several 
ISO AI Standards.63 By simultaneously encouraging 
experimentation and mandating responsible 
oversight, organizations can foster a sustainable 
ecosystem of innovation and performance benefits 
without sacrificing the reflection and scrutiny that 
is critical for responsible use.
Transparency and accountability are critical to 
combat inappropriate use. This requires clear 
guidance, policy, training, and oversight, and 
also a psychologically safe environment where 
employees feel comfortable to openly share 
how and when they are using AI tools in their 
work. This psychological safety not only enables 
better oversight and risk management but 
can also support a culture of shared learning, 
experimentation, continuous improvement, and 
the responsible diffusion of innovation across 
the organization (e.g. through communities 
of practice), helping to realize more of the 
performance benefits offered by AI technologies. 
Achieving this requires investment in structures 
and strategies to meaningfully engage with, 
listen to, and have honest conversations with 
employees about AI use and deployment.64 
Our findings further reinforce that high levels 
of trust and use of AI are not simply end goals. 
Rather, employees can be supported to develop 
appropriate levels of trust based on an informed 
understanding of the capabilities, limitations and 
risks of the AI system, and its appropriateness 
to the task at hand. Fully integrating training 
and guidance on responsible AI practices into 
everyday workflows—including onboarding 
processes, project work, and performance 
reviews—can help set healthy workplace 
norms around responsible AI use and support 
employees to develop well-calibrated trust.
Most employees surveyed want to learn more 
about AI, which can serve as a springboard to 
upskilling. Our research also suggests employees 
with low levels of AI literacy—such as older 
employees and those with lower incomes and 
no university education—may be at risk of 
experiencing what has been termed the ‘AI divide’: 
being left behind due to a lack of access or ability to 
use AI and benefit from the opportunities it offers.
AI adoption in the workplace is also having mixed 
impacts on human collaboration, stress and 
workload, employee surveillance, deskilling, and 
job security. Proactive management is required 
to help ensure that AI integration enhances 
rather than undermines trust, wellbeing, and skill 
development at work. For example, through work 
design that incorporates human–AI collaboration 
while preserving human relationships, strategic 
workforce planning and reskilling to support job 
security, and the ongoing development of human 
capabilities to mitigate deskilling and overreliance. 
A critical way organizations can help to strengthen 
stakeholder trust is by designing and using AI 
in ways that create demonstrable benefits and 
value for stakeholders, as well as by investing 
in assurance mechanisms that support and 
signal trustworthy use. The research indicates 
that people are more willing to trust AI systems 
when assurance mechanisms are in place, such 
as meaningful human oversight and accountability 
that enables over-riding or challenging AI 
recommendations, monitoring of system reliability, 
adhering to international AI standards, 
and independent third-party AI assurance. 
To date, much of the governance of AI has focused 
on the integration of AI into services, products 
and operations, and ensuring the principles of 
trustworthy AI (such as those reflected in the 
assurance mechanisms), are put into practice.65 
The research highlights the need to complement 
this governance with greater attention to 
employee use of AI and the impacts on work. 
Specifically, they highlight a need for organizations 
to better govern how employees are using AI 
tools and systems in their everyday work to create 
greater accountability and transparency, and to 
proactively manage and monitor the impacts 
of AI integration in the workplace.

Key actions for organizational leaders: 
•	 Invest in AI literacy to enhance human-AI 
collaboration skills, critical engagement, 
responsible use and appropriate trust in AI.
•	 Establish governance frameworks 
that support oversight, accountability, 
transparency, and risk management.

operational routines and decision-making.
•	 Create psychologically safe environments 
that support transparent and accountable 
use.
•	 Create structures to meaningfully 
engage with, listen to, and have honest 
conversations with employees about AI 
use and deployment.
•	 Invest in strategic workforce planning 
and reskilling to prepare for job and 
work changes.
•	 Understand, manage, and monitor the 
impacts of AI use on employees and 
the workplace.
•	 Ensure trust is earned, not assumed, 
by demonstrating responsible 
organizational AI use.
Key actions for managers: 
•	 Model responsible AI use and set clear 
norms and guidelines on appropriate use.
•	 Encourage ongoing dialogue about AI use, 
including where it adds value, where it 
introduces risk, and what support is needed.
•	 Balance innovation with risk management 
by supporting safe experimentation while 
ensuring compliance with organizational 
policies.
Key actions for employees:
•	 Be transparent about when and how AI 
tools are being used in work.
•	 Take initiative in developing AI literacy, 
particularly in understanding the strengths, 
limitations, and appropriate use cases for 
AI tools.
•	 Critically engage with AI tools and validate 
output when important for work.
•	 Stay informed about organizational policies 
on AI use and ensure they are followed.
•	 Support peers in responsible adoption by 
sharing learning, best practice, and raising 
concerns about inappropriate use.
Educating for an AI-augmented future: 
Implications for education providers, 
students, and employers
The findings reveal that AI use among students 
is pervasive, frequent, and driven primarily by 
freely available general-purpose generative 
AI tools. Students are clearly benefiting from 
from increased efficiency, enhanced access 
to information, greater innovation, more 
personalized learning, and reduced workloads 
and stress. However, students also report mixed 
cognitive, social-relational, and fairness impacts, 
and widespread inappropriate or complacent 
use of AI.
The implications of these mixed impacts are 
profound. While AI helps content production and 
efficient completion of learning and assessment 
tasks, it may also weaken the development of 
critical thinking, interpersonal skills, and social 
dynamics such as collaboration and interaction—all 
of which are critical life skills. Without intervention 
and management, students—the workforce 
of the future—are likely to be tech-savvy with 
well-developed AI capabilities, yet potentially 
underprepared for work that requires collaboration, 
strong interpersonal skills, critical thinking and 
completion of work without AI assistance.

For education providers, these findings emphasize 
the need for robust and explicit AI governance 
frameworks, as well as educational programs 
that develop students’ critical engagement with 
AI technologies. The findings suggest many 
educational providers are lagging behind in 
establishing clear guidance for their students, 
highlighting the need to proactively develop, 
integrate, and communicate AI policies and 
provide appropriate training to support responsible 
use and preserve the core educational outcomes 
essential to students’ long-term success. 
More broadly, the rise of AI is challenging 
conventional teaching models, suggesting 
a need for ongoing curriculum adaptation to 
ensure students are equipped with the skills 
to navigate an AI-augmented world, while 
continuing to develop their uniquely human 
capabilities. Educators must equip students for a 
workplace where AI is a ubiquitous tool, ensuring 
they develop both human-AI collaboration 
proficiency, together with the essential human 
skills that underpin leadership, innovation, 
collaboration, and ethical decision-making.
Simply banning AI use is not a viable option. 
Instead, teaching students how to question, 
verify, and critically engage with AI tools is a 
critical skillset for the future of work. Ultimately, 
the proliferation of student AI use leaves 
education providers little choice but to reimagine 
a new educational paradigm. This may require 
prioritizing collaborative assignments and in-
person engagement to ensure interpersonal 
skill development and redesigning assessment 
methods towards more interactive, process-
oriented evaluations (e.g. oral exams, in-class 
problem-solving tasks) and AI-assisted but 
human-verified work.Fostering a culture of 
academic integrity—where students see AI 
as an aid rather than a shortcut to developing 
their skills, knowledge and capabilities—will 
be equally crucial. 
These insights may also have implications for 
the workplace. It will pose a significant challenge 
for employers if students—as the workforce of 
the future—bring with them engrained norms of 
inappropriate AI use and ways of working that are 
at odds with organizational responsibilities. This 
reinforces the need for AI education, literacy and 
critical engagement with AI technologies to start 
early and be core to educational programs.
Key actions for education providers:
•	 Develop and communicate robust 
governance frameworks for the 
responsible use of AI in learning 
and assessment.
•	 Develop curricula and pedagogy that 
integrate AI literacy, human-AI collaboration 
skills, and critical evaluation of AI systems 
balanced with the development of uniquely 
human capabilities such as collaboration, 
teamwork, problem solving, and 
ethical reasoning.
•	 Use assessment methods that preserve 
academic integrity and skill development.
•	 Collaborate with industry to ensure 
educational curricula prepares students 
for the future of work.
Key actions for students:
•	 Engage with AI tools ethically, 
transparently, and in accordance with 
institutional guidelines. 
•	 Take initiative to learn how AI systems 
work, understand their limitations, and 
critically evaluate their outputs.
•	 View AI as a tool to support learning, not 
a shortcut: use it purposefully to develop 
skills, knowledge and capabilities.
Loss of human interaction due to AI is a 
significant societal concern. It is experienced 
by most people, including employees and 
students who report using AI rather than 
collaborating with others to complete work, 
raising the question of how human connectivity 
can be retained in AI-augmented workplaces, 
educational environments, and society at large. 
This particular challenge is less amenable to 
training, governance, or technical solutions. It 
leaves organizations to grapple with building and 
preserving meaningful connectivity, purpose, and 
belonging amidst increasingly virtual work and 
service delivery environments and a drive toward 
enhancing efficiency through AI-empowered 
technological solutions. Deliberate strategies

to maintain human connections will become 
increasingly essential, not only for attraction and 
retention of employees, but also for fostering a 
culture of collaboration and shared responsibility 
that underpins meaningful work, sustained 
performance, and broader societal wellbeing. 
There is no easy fix: addressing these challenges 
demands sustained organizational commitment 
and intentional strategies to balance technological 
efficiency with human-centric practices. 
Education providers and employers have a shared 
interest in ensuring people use AI effectively, 
responsibly, and in ways that enhance human 
potential and have positive societal outcomes. 
Education providers can lay the foundation by 
socializing students in responsible use and 
critical evaluation of when, where and how to 
appropriately use it. Organizations can reinforce 
and build upon this understanding through 
workplace practices, norms, governance, training 
and professional development. A cross-sectoral 
approach—rooted in shared responsibility and 
mutual learning among students, education 
providers, leaders, and employees—is important 
to ensure the next generation enters the 
workforce not only AI-capable, but also AI-wise.
Re-imagining the AI-enabled society: 
stewarding the responsible integration 
of AI requires a shared commitment 
The public’s shared concerns about AI stem 
broadly from three sources: AI malfunctions 
(e.g. bias, inaccurate outcomes, system failure), 
malicious or misleading use (e.g. misinformation 
and disinformation, manipulation or harmful use, 
cybersecurity risks), and inappropriate, reckless 
or overuse (e.g. deskilling and dependency, loss 
of human interaction, loss of privacy or IP).66 
Addressing and mitigating these root 
causes requires a range of technical, social, 
organizational, regulatory, and individual actions, 
highlighting the need for a coordinated approach 
at multiple levels. While our survey suggests the 
negative outcomes from AI are experienced less 
than the benefits, there is an argument that even 
the lowest experienced negative outcomes (i.e. 
bias and unfair treatment; experienced by a third) 
is unacceptable, and there is a moral obligation to 
do better.
These negative outcomes are being experienced 
or observed by a significant proportion of people 
across each of the 47 countries, indicating that 
these are no longer ‘potential’ risks: rather they 
are realized impacts. These negative impacts are of 
universal concern across the countries surveyed, 
and there is broad support for international 
cooperation and efforts to address them. 
The tension between the undeniable positive 
benefits from AI and the realized negative impacts 
raises questions about the kind of society and 
organizations we want to achieve with AI. Our 
survey shows that we are reaping the rewards of 
efficiency, effectiveness, innovation, and resource 
savings, but are also experiencing loss of human 
connection, privacy, mis- and disinformation, 
deskilling and dependency. We do not yet fully 
understand the long-term impacts, underscoring 
the importance of considered choices at every 
level about how AI is integrated into society 
and work. 
We hope this research will support individuals 
and organizations to make choices that practically 
resolve this tension in favor of AI’s benefits and 
inform a clearer vision of how an AI-enabled 
society can meet the needs and expectations of 
the public and support people and communities 
to thrive.

In this section, we explain the 
research methodology and 
statistical approach
Survey piloting, translations and 
procedure 
The research was approved by and adhered to 
the Guidelines of the ethical review process of 
The University of Queensland and the National 
Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research. 
The survey was divided into five sections 
with questions in each section focused on 
the respondent’s: a) demographic details; 
b) understanding of AI; c) use and attitudes 
toward AI systems (including trust, acceptance, 
risks, benefits, impacts and emotions); d) 
attitudes toward AI regulation, governance and 
management; e) attitudes, use and impacts of 
AI at work (only completed by those working) or 
in education (only completed by those studying). 
At the end of the survey, respondents were 
asked a series of open-ended questions.
After completing the first section on use 
and understanding of AI, participants read the 
definition of AI adapted from the OECD (see 
page 16), followed by a description of common 
ways AI is used to ensure understanding: 
“AI is used in a range of applications that do 
things such as generate text, images, and 
videos, predict what customers will buy, 
identify credit card fraud, identify people 
from their photos, help diagnose disease, 
and enable self-driving cars.” 
Questions in sections c and d of the survey 
referred to one of three specific AI applications or 
referred to ‘AI systems in general’. Respondents 
were randomly allocated to one of these AI 
applications, providing equivalent numbers of 
responses across each. Before answering these 
questions, respondents read a brief description 
of the AI application, including what it is used 
for, what it does and how it works (see full 
descriptions on page 16). The research team 
developed these descriptions based on a range of 
in-use systems with input from domain experts 
working in healthcare, Human Resources, and 
generative AI.
The survey was extensively piloted and refined 
before launch to ensure clarity and construct 
validity and reliability.67 To ensure survey 
equivalence across countries, we conducted 
translation and back-translation of the English 
version of the survey into the native language(s) 
dominant in each country, using separate 
professional translators. Respondents could also 
opt to complete the survey in English if preferred. 
To enhance the rigor and quality of the research, 
we applied established techniques to filter out 
inattentive survey responses.68 Individuals with 
rapid completion times suggestive of insufficient 
engagement were removed. We included 
attention checks at two points in the survey. 
Respondents were excluded if they failed these 
checks or failed one while also exhibiting straight-
lining behaviors (e.g. consistently selecting 
the same response across multiple survey 
items), nonsensical open-ended responses, or 
implausible answers across related question sets.

Survey measures
Where possible, we used or adapted existing 
validated measures from academic research 
(e.g. Haesvoets et al., 2021; Harmon-Jones et 
al., 2016; McKnight et al., 2002, 2011; Lee & 
Park, 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Zhang & Moffat, 
2015) or from previous public attitude surveys 
(e.g. Ipsos, 2017; Zhang & Dafoe, 2019). 
Trust in each specific AI application was 
measured using a reliable 7-item scale adapted 
from Gillespie (2012) and validated in our prior 
surveys. Example items are: “How willing 
are you to… Rely on information or content 
provided by an AI system” (willingness to rely); 
“Share relevant information about yourself to 
enable an AI system to perform a service or 
task for you” (willingness to share information); 
“Trust AI systems” (direct trust). Perceived 
trustworthiness was measured using a 9-item 
measure assessing positive expectations toward 
the AI system, adapted from McKnight et al. 
(2002). Example items include “I believe most 
AI applications: Produce output that is accurate” 
(ability); “Are safe and secure to use” (safe and 
ethical use). 
AI literacy was assessed using two indicators. 
AI knowledge was measured with four items 
adapted from Ipsos (2017) that assessed people’s 
belief that they feel informed about how AI is 
used, understand when AI is being used, feel 
they know about AI, and feel they have the skills 
and knowledge to use AI appropriately. AI efficacy 
was assessed with a 6-item measure adapted 
from validated subjective AI literacy scales (Lee & 
Park, 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Three items relate 
to the ability to use AI effectively (e.g. “I can… 
Skillfully use AI applications or products to help 
me with my daily work or activities”) and three 
to the ability to use AI responsibly (e.g. “Identify 
potential ethical issues associated with the use 
of AI applications”). This was supplemented with 
an objective measure of people’s knowledge 
of AI use in common applications by asking 
respondents whether three common AI 
applications (social media, virtual assistants, and 
facial recognition) use AI (yes, no or don't know).
Income was measured with a simplified version 
of the income question used by the World 
Values Survey (WVS; see Haerpfer et al., 2022). 
Specifically, we asked: “Please indicate which 
income group best describes your household 
income (counting all wages, salaries, pensions and 
other income sources).” Responses were provided 
on a 1-10 scale, where 1 = Lowest income group, 
5 = Middle income group, and 10 = Highest income 
group. There was also a ‘Prefer not to say’ option.
Most survey measures used either a 5 or 7-point 
Likert scale (e.g., ranging from strongly disagree 
(1) to strongly agree (7)). The psychometric 
properties of all multi-item constructs were 
assessed to examine reliability and dimensionality. 
Each measure met the criteria for reliability, 
with Cronbach alphas ranging from .81 (critical 
engagement with AI) to .96 (organizational support 
for responsible AI). 
Data analysis, statistical testing 
and reporting 
For ease of interpretation, percentages are 
reported in most places rather than means. 
When percentages did not add up to 100 percent 
due to rounding, we distributed the remaining value 
based on decreasing order of the values’ decimal 
part, as per the Largest Remainder Method. 
Some survey response scales provided a 
‘don’t know’ option. When 5 percent or more of 
respondents selected this option, we include it 
in the reporting of percentages. When less than 
5 percent, we remove these responses for ease 
of interpretation and recalculate percentages 
based on the remainder of the data.
Correlational analyses and structural equation 
modeling were conducted to examine 
associations between concepts. All correlations 
reported in-text are significant at p<.001. 
Reported relationships are based on theoretical 
or hypothesized relationships. Given the data 
is cross-sectional and self-reported, causality 
between concepts cannot and should not 
be inferred.
Our reporting of between-country, between-
application, between-people and within-person 
differences was based on statistical testing and 
adhered to well established benchmarks for 
interpreting between- and within-subject effect 
sizes (see Cohen, 1988; Lakens, 2013).

We used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
to examine differences between countries, 
AI applications and people (e.g. age category 
differences). We took several steps to ensure 
the responsible reporting of only meaningful 
differences in the data. First, we adopted a 
stringent cut-off of p<.001 to interpret statistical 
significance. Where there were statistically 
significant differences between groups, we 
examined the partial eta-squared effect size 
to determine the magnitude of differences 
between the groups. Given the large sample 
size, trivial effects can reach statistical 
significance; thus, we report only those findings 
with effect sizes of .03 or greater to focus on 
relationships that are substantively meaningful. 
This threshold ensures that reported findings 
reflect meaningful differences.69
We performed paired-sample t-tests to examine 
within-person differences (for instance, the 
variability in perceptions of the technical ability 
of AI systems and their safe and ethical use). 
We used a measure of effect size to determine 
the magnitude of statistically significant effects. 
Specifically, we used Hedges’ g with a cut-
off of .30 to indicate a robust and practically 
meaningful difference.70
Changes over time in the 17 countries surveyed 
in both 2022 and 2024 are based on survey 
questions asked about three common AI use 
applications: AI in general, Healthcare AI, and 
Human Resources AI. As such, comparative 
data presented is based only on the three AI 
applications. Questions about generative AI 
were only asked in 2024. Additionally, some 
measures were modified between 2022 and 
2024, with items added or removed. For these 
measures, composite values were recalculated 
using only items that remained the same or 
were substantively similar across both surveys.71
Because the samples at each time point are 
independent rather than longitudinal, changes 
over time should be interpreted as indicative of 
broad trends. We report statistically significant 
differences (p<.001) in Appendix 4 and illustrate 
the largest changes in the main text. While we 
use stringent effect size thresholds (e.g. n² ≥ .03) 
in cross-sectional analyses to ensure that only 
substantively large differences are highlighted, 
in repeated cross-sectional studies even small 
but statistically significant changes can signal 
consistent and informative population-level trends.

Overall and country demographic profiles 
The demographic profile of each country sample 
was nationally representative of the population 
on age, gender and regional location, within a 
5 percent margin of error, based on official national 
statistics within each country. The few exceptions 
are noted below.
Across countries, the gender balance was 
51 percent women, 49 percent men and <1 
percent other genders, with Costa Rica, Latvia, 
and Portugal having the highest representation 
of women (54%) and UAE the lowest (32%).
The mean age across countries was 46 years and 
ranged from 35 years (Costa Rica and Saudi Arabia) 
to 53 years (Japan). There was difficulty in reaching 
over-65-year-olds in eight countries: China (over 65s 
expected: 17%, achieved: 10%), Egypt (expected: 
9%, achieved: 5%), Greece (expected: 27%, 
achieved: 16%), Israel (expected: 18%, achieved: 
11%), Lithuania (expected: 25%, achieved: 14%), 
Portugal (expected: 27%, achieved: 17%), Slovenia 
(expected: 27%, achieved: 11%), and Türkiye 
(expected: 13%, achieved: 7%). Respondents from 
China, Egypt, and Nigeria also tended to be more 
urban than the general population. We were unable 
to source reliable location data for the UAE and 
Slovenia. Data collected in Israel did not include 
the West Bank settlement and data collected in 
China was contained to mainland China. 
Country samples represented the full diversity 
of education levels. While levels of university 
education broadly matched the respective 
populations in most advanced economies, country 
samples tended to overrepresent university-
educated people in emerging economies relative 
to their respective general populations (using 
OECD 2024 education data as a comparison72). It is 
common for online survey respondents in countries 
with emerging economies to be better educated, 
as well as more urban, younger, and affluent, than 
those in the general population in those countries.73
Given non-representativeness related to age 
and education in some of our country samples, 
we performed additional robustness checks to 
ensure differences reported across countries and 
economies are not merely artifacts of differences 
in age or education. We examined differences 
between emerging and advanced economies—and 
countries—on key indicators when controlling for 
the effects of education and age, using multivariate 
analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) tests. The pattern 
of results did not change; when we report economy 
and country differences, these remain significant 
and meaningful when controlling for education and 
age. These analyses indicate that the observed 
differences across countries and economies are not 
simply due to demographic differences in age or 
education across country samples.
Employee demographic profile
Sixty-seven percent of the total sample were 
employed (52% full-time; 15% part-time), yielding 
32,352 respondents answering questions about 
AI use at work. The proportion of employees 
ranged from 50 percent (Belgium, Finland) to 
89 percent (UAE). Among workers, 53 percent 
were male and 47 percent female, with a mean 
age of 41 (range = 18-95). Most were employed 
by an organization (77%), followed by self-
employment (16%) and business ownership (7%). 
Respondents worked across diverse industries 
(e.g. power and utilities = 2%, manufacturing = 
11%) and occupations (e.g. service and sales = 
10%, professional and skilled = 32%).
Student demographic profile
Students comprised 5% of the sample (n = 2,499), 
with 56 percent female and 44 percent male. 
The mean age was 23 (range = 18-86), with 65% 
enrolled in university, 18% in secondary education, 
16% in vocational, trade, or technical programs, 
and 1% in other forms of education. Student 
respondents were present in all countries (range = 
28 [Switzerland] to 115 [Nigeria]). Country-level and 
economic group analyses were not conducted, 
due to the small subsample sizes.

5	 Intentional use was differentiated 
from the passive use of AI (e.g. when 
AI operates behind the scenes in 
tools such as email filters and search 
engines). General-purpose generative 
AI tools were the most common class 
of AI intentionally used at work. We use 
the term as defined and explained in this 
report by the European Parliament.
6	 We adopted the International Monetary 
Fund’s (IMF) classification of advanced 
and emerging economies.
7	 Robustly answering the question 
of which countries are leading AI 
adoption and use requires a different 
methodology to public attitude surveys. 
The conclusions here are based on the 
perceptions and experiences reported 
by a representative sampling of the 
public. They are not based on objective 
indicators of AI adoption, investment, or 
AI education and training.
8	 To define global regions, we draw from 
the United Nations (2023). Standard 
Country or Area Codes for Statistical 
Use (49).
9	 Survey responses were collected from 
individuals in mainland China only, 
excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
10	We focused primarily on the 2023 
Government AI Readiness Index. This 
index ranks and provides a total score 
for 193 countries on AI readiness across 
three pillars: Government (e.g. existence 
of a national AI strategy, cyber-
security), Technology (e.g. number of AI 
unicorns, R&D spending), and Data and 
Infrastructure (e.g. telecommunications 
infrastructure, households with internet 
access). The countries selected had 
rankings at or near the top for their 
region on the 2023 Government AI 
Readiness Index. We supplemented 
this with data from the 2024 Stanford 
AI Index, which examines country-level 
private investment in AI and acceleration 
in AI activity over time to enable the 
identification of countries that are rapidly 
emerging in AI in regions that historically 
lacked AI capacity and investment (e.g. 
South Africa, Brazil, India, Mexico, 
Portugal, the UAE, etc.).
11	 See Adams, R., Adeleke, F., Florido, 
A., de Magalhães Santos, L. G., 
Grossman, N., Junck, L., & Stone, K. 
(2024). Global Index on Responsible AI 
2024 (1st Edition). South Africa: Global 
Center on AI Governance. https://girai-
report-2024-corrected-edition.tiiny.
site/ This index assesses responsible 
AI governance across 138 countries, 
measuring human rights protections, 
AI governance policy, and institutional 
capacities through government actions, 
frameworks, and non-state actor 
initiatives.
12	 China is considered an emerging 
economy by the IMF despite its large 
size and economic power because, 
while it has experienced rapid GDP 
growth and industrialization, its per 
capita income remains significantly 
lower than developed nations, indicating 
that its economy is still transitioning 
toward a fully developed state; this is 
further supported by factors like ongoing 
economic reforms, a large developing 
market, and a focus on infrastructure 
development.
13	Data was collected from representative 
research panels sourced by Dynata, a 
global leader in survey research panel 
provision.
14	Income was assessed using a question 
from the World Values Survey Group 
(WVS; Haerpfer et al., 2022). It was self-
reported on a 10-point scale from 1 = 
Lowest income group to 10 = Highest 
income group with a ‘Prefer not to say’ 
option. For demographic analysis, we re-
coded responses into three categories: 
Low = 1-3, Medium = 4-7, High = 8-10. 
This is aligned with WVS categorization.
15	Occupational groupings were 
sourced from the International Labor 
Organization’s International Standard 
Classifications of Occupations.
16	We adapted and simplified the definition 
to make it accessible to a broad and 
diverse range of people with varying 
levels of reading ability, while retaining 
key defining elements. See discussion 
of the evolution of the OECD definition 
of AI in: What is AI? Can you make a 
clear distinction between AI and non-
AI systems? Across this report, the 
terms “AI” and “AI System” are used 
interchangeably for simplicity.
17	 Four of the 17 countries surveyed 
at both time points are emerging 
economies: Brazil, China, India, and 
South Africa. However, as there is no 
clear differences between advanced 
and emerging economies in changes 
over time, so we do not distinguish 
between them in reporting the findings 
of change.
18	Responses to the four items assessing 
AI knowledge were aggregated to 
produce an overall score.

19	In support of this interpretation, 
the 2024 Stanford AI Index reports 
accelerated use and adoption of AI in 
several emerging economies, as well 
as the increasing economic importance 
of AI in these countries. Our pattern 
of findings aligns with a recent Ipsos/
Google survey that demonstrates AI use 
and positive attitudes are particularly 
high in emerging economies.
20	This definition aligns with dominant 
interdisciplinary definitions of trust (e.g. 
Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau et al., 2009), 
including trust in technological systems 
(see McKnight et al., 2002, 2011).
21	Perceptions of trustworthiness 
are typically higher than trusting 
intentions because trust involves risk 
and vulnerability (e.g. by relying on AI 
output or sharing information with an AI 
system), whereas perceiving a system as 
trustworthy does not. There is a strong 
association between the perceived 
trustworthiness of AI systems and 
trusting AI systems (r=.79).
22	We also find people are more willing 
to share information with healthcare AI 
systems (57%, M=4.5), than rely on the 
output of these systems (48%, M=4.2), 
reflecting the expectation that sharing 
information with healthcare providers 
and systems is a routine and necessary 
part of health care provision. We find this 
difference between willingness to share 
information and rely on AI systems 
across applications.
23	Norway’s high level of trust in AI systems, 
compared to many other advanced 
economies, may reflect Norwegians’ 
comparatively high levels of AI training 
and literacy, workplace adoption of 
AI, trust in government use of AI, and 
awareness of laws and regulation relating 
to AI, as evidenced in this report.
24	The 2024 Stanford AI Index reports 
accelerated use and adoption of AI in 
several emerging economies, as well as 
the increasing economic importance of AI 
in these countries. Our pattern of findings 
aligns with a recent Ipsos/Google survey 
that demonstrates AI use and positive 
attitudes are particularly high in emerging 
economies.
25	We asked questions related to the 
experience or observation of benefits and 
risks only of people who reported they 
had experience with the AI application 
they were allocated, i.e. AI systems (59% 
reported experience; Emerging = 68%. 
Advanced = 55%), Generative AI (50% 
experienced; Emerging = 60%, Advanced 
= 45%), AI use in Human Resources 
(21% experienced; Emerging = 31%, 
Advanced = 15%), or AI use in Healthcare 
(18% experienced; Emerging = 28%, 
Advanced = 13%).
26	Some benefits were observed or 
experienced more in relation to the use of 
AI in Human Resources and Healthcare. 
Specifically, people had experienced or 
observed increased fairness from AI use 
in Human Resources and Healthcare 
(62-64%) more so than from Generative 
AI tools or AI systems in general (41%-
42%), and reduced costs and better 
use of resources from AI use in Human 
Resources and Healthcare (68-74%) 
compared to Generative AI or AI 
systems (59-60%).
27	The list of risks and benefits was the 
outcome of extensive survey piloting 
including analysis of open-ended 
questions asking about benefits and 
risks of AI systems.
28	Independent surveys showing public 
desire for regulation include: The Ada 
Lovelace Institute and The Alan Turing 
Institute (2025). How do people feel 
about AI? Wave two of a nationally 
representative survey of UK attitudes 
to AI. Eurobarometer (2025). Artificial 
Intelligence and the future of work. Saeri, 
A., Noetel, M., & Graham, J. (2024). 
Survey Assessing Risks from Artificial 
Intelligence (Technical Report). Rethink 
Priorities (2023). US public opinion of AI 
policy and risk.
29	Ipsos (2024). Public trust in AI: 
Implications for policy and regulation. 
Seth, J. (2024). Public Perception of AI: 
Sentiment and Opportunity.
30	One of the most significant reforms to 
legislation and regulation of AI is the 
EU AI Act, which governs members of 
the European Union. This act officially 
entered into force on 1 August 2024, and 
intends to be fully applicable by 2 August 
2026, with some exceptions. We found 
no difference in the perceived adequacy 
of regulation or awareness of regulation 
between people in countries governed 
by the EU AI Act and people in other 
countries with advanced economies. 
This likely reflects that our data collection 
preceded the practical implementation of 
the obligations of the EU AI Act, which 
commenced on 2 February 2025.
31	Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a 
suite of multivariate techniques that offers 
advantages over other regression-based 
approaches. It explicitly accounts for 
measurement error to yield less biased 
estimates, estimates latent constructs 
from observed indicators, and evaluates 
the fit between the model and the data. 
Our model fit the data well: x2 (N = 
46524, df = 2272) = 113119.70, p < .001; 
CFI: .94, TLI: .94, SRMR: .07, RMSEA: .03. 
For an accessible guide to the structural 
equation modeling process, see Kline, 
R. B. (2023). Principles and Practices of 
Structural Equation Modeling (5th ed.). 
Guilford Press: New York.
32	‘B’ refers to the standardized beta 
coefficient, which indicates the strength 
of the effect of each independent variable 
(i.e., driver) on the dependent variable 
(i.e., outcome). Beta coefficients can be 
compared to indicate the relative strength 
of each independent variable. B=.43 from 
trust to acceptance means that if trust 
increases by one standard deviation, 
acceptance is expected to increase by 
about .43 standard deviations.

38	See appendix 2 for further details of the 
employee sample.
39	As participants could select multiple 
options, the percentages sum to more 
than 100%. These options were derived 
from thematic analysis of the key 
reasons for not using AI identified by 
employees during our two pilot studies 
conducted to inform and validate the 
survey questions. We also included an 
‘other’ option in our global survey to 
capture participants qualitative reasons 
for not using AI, which was completed 
by 360 participants. Thematic analysis 
of this data revealed the majority (78%) 
of reasons overlapped with the options 
reported here.
40	There is no difference across economic 
groups in the use of publicly available tools 
(71% in emerging economies vs. 70% 
in advanced) or tools managed by one’s 
organization (43% vs. 41%, respectively).
41	 A caveat is that these differences 
between economic groups may, in part, 
reflect that employees in emerging 
economies have higher levels of AI 
training and literacy, resulting in a greater 
understanding of AI and when and how 
it is used at work, rather than the actual 
use of AI by the organization.
42	Social desirability bias refers to the 
tendency for research subjects to 
give socially desirable responses to 
sensitive questions instead of providing 
responses that reflect their true feelings 
or experiences (see Grimm, 2010, for 
an overview).

45	We adapted a measure from Haesevoets, 
de Cremer, Dierckx & van Hiel. (2021).

46	This finding also supports prior research 
reporting concerns about potential job 
losses resulting from AI and automation. 
For example: ADP Research Institute 
(2024). People at Work 2024: A Global 
Workforce View; Eurobarometer (2025).

work; Pew Research Center (2025). How

47	Organizational support of AI (AI strategy, 
culture, and support for AI literacy) 
has no discernible impact on critical 
engagement. This is likely because its 
power in predicting critical engagement 
is largely captured by the more direct 
measure of AI literacy.	
48	Given some groups of employees are 
significantly more likely to use AI at 
work, we controlled for AI use frequency 
when analyzing demographic influences 
on inappropriate and complacent use 
behaviors in multivariate analysis of 
covariance (MANCOVA) models. This is 
important because frequency of AI use at 
work is a strong predictor of complacent 
or inappropriate use of AI (effect size [n²] 
= .05 to .12). Without controlling for use, 
demographic effects may be inflated, 
reflecting greater exposure to AI rather 
than meaningful differences in how AI 
is used by different groups of people.	
49	The partial eta-squared effect size (n²) 
helps to explain the practical magnitude 
of the effect of one variable on another 
after considering the influence of other 
variables in the model. Effect sizes of 
.01, .06, .14 indicate small, medium, and 
large effects, respectively. The University 
of Cambridge’s MRC Cognition and 
Brain Sciences Unit provides a user-
friendly primer on effect sizes. See 
also see Lakens, D. (2013). Calculating 
and reporting effect sizes to facilitate 
cumulative science: A practical primer 
for t-tests and ANOVAS. Frontiers in 
Psychology, 4, 863	
50	Industry groups were adapted from 
the International Labour Organization 
International Standard Industrial 
Classification of all economic activities.
51	In a historical context, it can be viewed 
as normal early in the journey of adopting 
a powerful, disruptive and transformative 
technology for there to be a period 
of ambivalence and adjustment until 
appropriate standards, best practice, 
norms, governance and regulation 
emerges to guide development and 
use and mitigate harms.
52	See the European Commission’s (EC) 
outline of the European approach 
to artificial intelligence, which is 
underpinned by the EU AI Act. The EC 
notes that fostering excellence in AI will 
strengthen Europe’s ability to compete 
globally, and that trust is central to the 
vision of making the EU a world-class 
hub for AI while ensuring safety and 
fundamental rights.
53	As history has shown, this is not the 
first time a technology has created 
this tension, nor will it be the last time.

Capital, Labor, and Power in the Age of

55	See Google’s 2024 report examining 
the economic potential of AI in 
emerging markets.
56 A recent Ipsos/Google survey also 
supports this view, showing that 
people in emerging economies—and 
particularly Nigeria—are more likely 
to think that AI will have a positive 
impact on the economy, suggesting 
positive perceptions of AI as a driver 
of economic prosperity.

doesn’t bode well for the fight against 
misinformation; For further evidence-

Based Policy Guide | Carnegie

61	The levels of organizational support 
for responsible AI may be even lower 
in practice than how it is reported by 
employees. This perception-practice gap 
is illustrated by the 2024 Responsible 
AI Index, which found that while most 
executives believe their AI systems align 
with responsible AI principles, fewer 
than one-third had actively implemented 
responsible AI practices.
62	A 2024 Boston Consulting Group study 
found that only 26% of organizations 
surveyed have developed the necessary 
capabilities to move beyond proof-of-
concept and generate tangible AI value 
at scale.
63	For example, ISO Standards 42001, 
23894, and 38507 can all help 
organizations with their AI governance. 
Further, for an overview of over 900 
resources to support responsible AI use, 
see the OECD’s Tools for Trustworthy 
AI - OECD.AI.
64	Research by the Human Technology 
Institute at the University of Technology 
Sydney finds that many employees 
feel they are ""invisible bystanders"" 
in the adoption of AI into their work; 
that technology is imposed on them 
rather than being designed with them. 
The research recommends creating 
avenues for structured engagement 
with employees around AI deployment.
65	Current AI governance has heavily 
emphasized systemic issues—
addressing how AI systems are built and 
how they impact society at large—and 
comparatively less emphasis has been 
placed on regulating or guiding the 
use of AI by individuals. Major policy 
frameworks and principles—from the 
EU and OECD to national strategies—
emphasize themes such as fairness, 
transparency, safety, accountability, and 
human oversight, and typically target AI 
developers and deployers. Regarding 
AI use in organizations, see Bird & Bird 
(2025) AI Governance: Essential Insights 
for Organizations for analysis observing 
that most policies focus on high-level 
standards rather than providing granular 
guidance around training employees 
on AI governance or setting rules for 
employees’ day-to-day AI usage.

of AI Governance in Australia, Human 
Technology Institute, The University of

67	We received extensive feedback on 
the survey throughout its development 
from academic and industry experts 
and conducted two large-scale pilot 
tests (Pilot 1, N = 751 respondents 
from the UK, USA, and Australia; Pilot 
2, N = 793 respondents from the USA 
and UK). During these pilot tests, we 
specifically solicited feedback on the 
construct and face validity of new 
measures by providing respondents with 
definitions and asking them to assess 
whether these adequately covered the 
intended construct, as well as broader 
recommendations to enhance the survey.
68	Research suggests that using multiple 
indicators to determine respondent 
attentiveness is important:  Ward, M. 
K., & Meade, A. W. (2023). Dealing 
with careless responding in survey 
data: Prevention, identification, and

69	See Field, A. (2013). Discovering statistics 
using IBM SPSS statistics (4th ed.). Sage: 
London. (See page 474; values for w2 of 
.01, .06, .14 indicate small, medium, and 
large effects respectively).
70	As a rule of thumb, a Hedges' g value of 
.2 is considered a small effect size, .5 a 
medium effect size, and .8 or larger, a 
large effect size (see Lakens, D. (2013) 
Calculating and reporting effect sizes to 
facilitate cumulative science: A practical 
primer for t-tests and ANOVAS. Frontiers 
in Psychology, 4, 863). However, 
interpretation of effect sizes is subjective, 
and we have chosen a cut-off of .3 rather 
than .2 because this ensures a practically 
meaningful and robust difference which 
trends toward a medium, rather than a 
small effect.
71	 Respondents’ belief that their 
organization uses AI was asked in a yes/
no/don’t know format in 2022, while the 
extent of organizational use (ranging from 
1 = not at all to 5 = to a very large extent) 
was asked in 2024. As such, this variable 
was re-coded into use (responses = 
2-4) vs. no use (response = 1) in order to 
make meaningful comparisons. Similarly, 
employee AI use was measured slightly 
differently across time. Change in total 
use, rather than regular or semi-regular 
use, is reported.
72	Comparative data sourced from

attitude surveys (e.g. see University 
of Oxford’s Reuters Institute report

Climate news use and attitudes in eight 
countries, and the OECD's technical 
details of its 2021 survey of drivers 
of trust in government institutions for 
acknowledgement and discussion).

Empowering human-AI collaboration for a trusted future
Share
AI has the immense potential to transform lives, boost industries and help tackle some of the most pressing global issues. Fully realising this potential requires collaboration, a collective commitment to responsible innovation and appropriate regulation with education programs and skills development initiatives to help individuals better harness AI’s power.
Led by the University of Melbourne in collaboration with KPMG,Trust, attitudes and use of Artificial Intelligence: A global study 2025opens in a new tab, surveyed more than 48,000 people across 47 countries to explore the impact AI is having on individuals and organisations. It is one of the most wide-ranging global studies into the public’s trust, use, and attitudes towards AI to date.
The findings reveal that AI adoption is on the rise, but trust remains a critical challenge - reflecting a tension between the benefits and risks:
66% of people use AI regularly, and83% believe the use of AI will result in a wide range of benefits.
Yet, trust remains a critical challenge: only46% of people globally are willing to trust AI systems.
There is a public mandate for national and international AI regulation with70% believing regulation is needed.
Manyrely on AI output without evaluating accuracy(66%) and are making mistakes in their work due to AI (56%).

Empowering human-AI collaboration for a trusted future
This research, along with our perspective on the findings, offers a data-driven view of where leadership focus, strategic investment and workforce enablement are most urgently needed and how rising public expectations for strong AI regulation and governance need to be addressed.
For organisations to realise the true potential of AI and achieve a competitive advantage, there are four key actions that leaders should prioritise:
By acting decisively to address these areas, organisations can not only mitigate current risks but also drive sustainable innovation and growth.
Alongside the study, we’ve developed our perspective on the global study’s finding -The age of Intelligence – Empowering human-AI collaboration for a trusted futureopens in a new tabexplores the implications for organisations and highlights how they can leverage these insights to harness the transformative power of AI.

Executive summary
The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 brought the transformative power 
of AI firmly into the public consciousness and everyday experience. 
While exponential investment in AI predated its release, individual and 
organizational use of AI has increased dramatically and rapidly since 2022.1 
For example, OpenAI’s suite of generative AI tools obtained over 100 million 
users in only two months.2 AI is now firmly part of everyday life and work 
for many people and is widely embraced across all sectors of the global 
economy, including finance, education, transport, manufacturing, agriculture, 
healthcare, retail, and media.3 
The benefits and promise of AI for society and 
business are undeniable. AI systems are being 
used to make cancer detection faster and more 
accurate, enhance the efficiency of renewable 
energies, and drive productivity and innovation 
in the workplace, among other impactful use 
cases.4 However, as AI’s capabilities and reach 
become more apparent, so too has awareness 
of the risks and challenges, raising questions 
about the trustworthiness, regulation, and 
governance of AI systems. The public’s trust in AI 
technologies and its responsible and ethical use 
is central to sustained acceptance and adoption 
and in realizing the full societal and economic 
benefits of these technologies.
Given the rapid advancement and widespread 
adoption of AI technologies—and their 
transformative effects on society, work, education, 
and the economy—bringing the public voice into 
the conversation has never been more critical. 
This research aims to provide an evidence-based 
understanding of people’s trust, use and attitudes 
toward AI, their views on the impacts of AI, and 
expectations of its governance and regulation. 
The insights are important to inform public policy 
and industry practice and a human-centered 
approach to stewarding AI into work and society. 
They can help policymakers, organizational leaders, 
and those involved in developing, deploying, and 
governing AI systems to understand and align 
with evolving public expectations, and deepen 
understanding of the opportunities and challenges 
of AI integration. 
The report provides timely, global research 
insights on a range of questions, including the 
extent to which people trust, use, and understand 
AI systems; how they perceive and experience 
the benefits, risks and impacts of AI use in 
society, at work and in education; expectations 
for the management, governance and regulation 
of AI by organizations and governments; how 
employees and students are using AI for work 
and study; and perceived support for the 
responsible use of AI. It draws out commonalities 
and differences in these key dimensions across 
countries and sub-groups of the population, and 
sheds light on how trust and attitudes toward AI 
have changed over the past two years since the 
widespread uptake of generative AI. 
Next, we summarize the key research insights.
Now in its fourth iteration, the research captures 
the views of more than 48,000 people from 
47 countries, representing all global geographic 
regions. It offers the most comprehensive 
examination to date of public trust and attitudes 
toward AI. In addition, it takes a deep dive into 
how employees and students use AI in work 
and education and their experience of the 
impacts of AI in these specific settings.

A snapshot of key findings
Trust and acceptance of AI
Trust in AI systems remains a significant 
challenge: over half (54%) are wary about 
trusting AI. People are more skeptical of 
the safety, security and societal impact of 
AI and more trusting of its technical ability. 
While most people feel both optimistic 
and worried about AI, 72% accept its use. 
People in advanced economies are less 
trusting (39% vs. 57%) and accepting (65% 
vs. 84%) compared to emerging economies.
AI use and understanding
Two in three (66%) intentionally use AI on a 
regular basis and three in five say they can 
use AI effectively. However, most (61%) 
have no AI training and half report limited 
knowledge. People in emerging economies 
report higher regular use (80% vs 58%), 
training (50% vs 32%), knowledge (64% vs 
46%) and efficacy (74% vs 51%) than those 
in advanced economies. People that are 
younger, university-educated, higher-income 
earners and AI-trained report more trust, 
use and AI literacy. 
AI benefits and risks 
People report experiencing both benefits 
and negative outcomes from AI use. 
While many report improved efficiency, 
accessibility, decision-making and innovation, 
concerns about cybersecurity, privacy and IP, 
misinformation, loss of human connection, 
job loss and deskilling are widespread. The 
public's ambivalence towards AI is evident, 
with divided opinion on whether the benefits 
outweigh the risks in advanced economies.
AI regulation and governance 
There is a strong public mandate for AI 
regulation, with 70% believing regulation is 
necessary. However, only 43% believe current 
laws are adequate. People expect international 
laws (76%), national government regulation 
(69%), and co-regulation with industry (71%). 
87% also want laws and fact-checking to 
combat AI-generated misinformation.
AI adoption in the workplace 
Three in five (58%) employees intentionally 
use AI at work on a regular basis, with a 
third using it weekly. Generative AI tools are 
most commonly used with many employees 
opting for free, publicly available tools rather 
than employer-provided options. Emerging 
economies are leading in employee adoption 
with 72% using AI regularly compared to 
49% in advanced economies.
Impacts of AI at work
Over half of employees report performance 
benefits from AI. However, employees also 
report mixed impacts on workload, human 
interaction and compliance and two in five 
believe AI will replace jobs in their area. Many 
employees report inappropriate, complacent 
and non-transparent use of AI in their work, 
contravening policies and resulting in errors 
and dependency. Governance and training 
to support responsible AI use appears to 
be lagging adoption.
Student engagement with AI 
Four in five students (83%, predominately 
tertiary) regularly use AI in their studies, 
reporting benefits such as efficiency, 
personalization of learning, and reduced 
workload and stress. However, inappropriate, 
complacent and non-transparent use of AI by 
students is widespread, raising concerns about 
over-reliance and diminished critical thinking, 
collaboration, and equity of assessment. 
Only half report their education provider has 
policies, resources or training to support 
responsible AI use.

The age of working with AI is here and is 
delivering performance benefits, but also 
mixed impacts
Across countries, almost three in five employees 
intentionally5 use AI at work on a regular basis, 
with almost a third using it weekly or more. 
General-purpose generative AI tools are by far 
the most widely used, with most employees 
using free, public tools like ChatGPT rather than 
tools provided by their employer. Three in four 
report that their organization uses AI, with almost 
half stating AI is used in a broad range of tasks 
and functions. 
Emerging economies6 are leading workplace 
adoption of AI, with employees in these economies 
more likely to use AI regularly (72% vs 49%) than 
those in advanced economies. 
The use of AI at work is clearly delivering a range 
of positive performance benefits. Most employees 
report increased work efficiency, access to accurate 
information, innovation, higher quality of work and 
decisions, and better use and development of 
skills and abilities. Almost half report that AI use 
has increased revenue-generating activity. 
However, employees also report mixed impacts 
on workload, stress, human collaboration, 
compliance, and surveillance at work. For example, 
half say they use AI rather than collaborating with 
peers or supervisors to get work done, and one 
in five say AI use has reduced communication, 
interaction and collaboration, raising the question 
of how human connectivity will be retained in AI-
augmented workplaces. These insights underscore 
the importance of understanding and managing 
the impacts of AI at work, ensuring appropriate 
work design, and building employee capabilities 
in effective human-AI collaboration. 
The responsible use and governance of 
AI is not keeping pace with adoption: 
many employees are using AI in 
complacent and inappropriate ways 
which increase risk
While the rapid adoption of AI is delivering 
benefits, many employees are using AI in 
complacent and inappropriate ways, increasing 
risks for organizations and individuals and raising 
quality issues. For example, almost half admit to 
using AI in ways that contravene organizational 
policies and uploading sensitive company 
information, such as financial, sales, or customer 
information, to public AI tools. Three in five report 
they have seen or heard of other employees 
using AI tools in inappropriate ways. Two in three 
report relying on AI output without evaluating the 
information it provides, and over half say they 
have made mistakes in their work due to AI.
What makes these risks even more challenging 
to manage is that over half of employees avoid 
revealing when they use AI to complete their work 
and present AI-generated content as their own. 
These findings highlight a lack of transparency and 
accountability in the way AI, particularly generative 
AI tools, are being used by employees at work. 
This complacent use may be fueled by inadequate 
training, guidance, and governance of responsible 
AI use at work: within organizations that use 
AI, only one in two employees in advanced 
economies report that their organization offers 
training in responsible AI, has policies and 
practices on responsible AI use, or a strategy and 
culture that supports AI. Despite the high use of 
generative AI tools, only two in five say there is a 
policy guiding its use. Complacent use may also 
be exacerbated by a sense of pressure to use AI, 
with half of employees feeling they will be left 
behind if they don’t.
From a governance perspective, these findings 
highlight a critical gap and urgent need for 
organizations to proactively invest in responsible 
AI training and the AI literacy of employees 
to promote critical engagement with AI tools. 
They also underscore the need to put in place 
mechanisms to effectively guide and govern how 
employees use AI tools in their everyday work, 
to promote greater accountability, transparency, 
and employee engagement.

Most students use AI and report benefits, 
but inappropriate use and over-reliance 
is widespread and challenging critical 
skill development 
The findings for students (predominately tertiary 
students) provide insight into how AI is being 
used by the next generation of the workforce and 
affecting education and training. Results mirror 
those for employees but are more pronounced. 
Four in five (83%) students regularly use AI in 
their studies, with half using it weekly or daily. 
The large majority use free, publicly available 
generative AI tools. 
Most students are deriving significant benefits 
from AI use in education, such as increased 
efficiency, access to information, quality of work, 
idea generation and personalization of learning, 
and reduced workload and stress. However, AI’s 
influence on social dynamics, critical thinking, 
and assessment is mixed. For example, a quarter 
to a third of students report reduced critical 
thinking and less communication, interaction, 
and collaboration with instructors and peers. 
A similar number perceive less trust of students 
by instructors and peers, and reduced fairness 
and equity of assessment due to AI.
The complacent use of AI by students is 
widespread. Most students have used AI 
inappropriately, contravening rules and guidelines 
and over-relying on AI. Two-thirds have not 
been transparent in their AI use, presenting 
AI-generated content as their own and hiding 
their use of AI tools. Only half regularly engage 
critically with AI tools and their output. 
The level of student dependence on AI is 
concerning: over three-quarters have felt they 
could not complete their work without the 
help of AI and rely on it to do tasks rather than 
learning how themselves. Four in five say they 
put less effort into their studies and assessment 
knowing they can rely on AI. 
A lack of institutional support for responsible AI 
use may be contributing to this problem: only half 
of students report their education provider has 
policies to guide responsible use of AI in learning 
and assessment, or training and resources to 
support AI understanding and responsible use.
These findings may have longer-term implications 
for the effective development of essential skills—
such as critical thinking, communication and 
collaboration, with implications for organizations 
as these students enter the workforce. 
Trust in AI cannot be taken for granted: 
many people are wary about trusting 
AI systems, particularly in advanced 
economies
Despite high rates of individual adoption, trust 
remains a critical challenge. Over half (54%) 
of people are wary about trusting AI systems. 
Underlying this average are differences between 
economic groups: three in five people in 
advanced economies are unwilling or unsure 
about trusting AI systems. In contrast, in 
emerging economies, three in five people trust 
AI systems. We find similar levels for employee 
trust in the use of AI at work, and student trust 
of AI for educational purposes.
People are more skeptical about the safety, 
security, and ethical use of AI systems and more 
trusting of the technical ability of AI to provide 
helpful output and services. This helps explain 
individual use of AI to gain performance benefits, 
despite trust concerns around its broader impact 
on society and people. While the majority accept 
the use of AI systems, most people report low 
or moderate acceptance and approval levels. 
People’s ambivalence toward AI is also reflected 
in their emotions: the majority report optimism 
and excitement, coupled with worry. 
People have high confidence in universities, 
research, and healthcare institutions to use and 
develop AI in the best interests of the public, 
and generally less confidence in government 
to do so. People in advanced economies have 
lower confidence in industry and big technology 
companies to develop and use AI in the public 
interest, whereas confidence in these entities 
is high in emerging economies.
Organizations can build stakeholders’ trust in 
their use of AI by investing in responsible AI 
governance mechanisms that signal trustworthy 
use: four in five people report they would 
be more willing to trust an AI system when 
assurance mechanisms are in place, such as 
monitoring system reliability, human oversight and 
accountability, responsible AI policies and training, 
adhering to international AI standards, and 
independent third-party AI assurance systems.

People are experiencing a range of 
benefits and negative outcomes from 
the use of AI in society 
People’s ambivalence toward AI stems from the 
mixed benefits, risks and negative impacts that 
are being felt from AI use in society: 42 percent 
believe the benefits outweigh the risks, 32 percent 
believe the risks outweigh the benefits, and 
26 percent believe the benefits and risks 
are balanced.
Three in four report experiencing a broad 
range of benefits, including improved efficiency 
and effectiveness, enhanced accessibility to 
information and services, greater precision and 
personalization, improved decision-making and 
outcomes, greater innovation and creativity, 
reduced costs and better use of resources. 
These outcomes benefit individuals, while 
also bringing performance-oriented benefits 
to organizations and society more broadly. 
However, people’s experience of these benefits 
is coupled with clear concerns about the risks 
and negative impacts of AI on society. Four in 
five people are concerned about—and two in 
five have personally experienced or observed—
negative outcomes from AI. These include 
the loss of human interaction and connection, 
cybersecurity risks, loss of privacy or intellectual 
property, misinformation and manipulation, 
harmful or inaccurate outcomes, deskilling and 
dependency, job loss, and disadvantage from 
unequal access to AI. Comparatively fewer 
people are concerned about AI bias resulting in 
unfair treatment and the environmental impact of 
AI, however even these outcomes are reported 
by a third of people surveyed. 
Respondents across countries share similar 
views and experiences regarding AI risks and 
negative outcomes, highlighting these as areas 
of universal concern. These negative outcomes 
are not just ‘perceived risks’ but harms that are 
being experienced or observed by a significant 
proportion of people across the 47 countries 
surveyed. These findings reinforce the need for 
international cooperation and coordinated action 
to prevent and mitigate AI risks and negative 
impacts. The challenge is doing this in a balanced 
way that does not undermine progress or hinder 
the innovation required to realize the many 
societal benefits of AI. 
The public expect AI regulation at both 
the national and international level. 
Yet the current regulatory landscape 
is falling short of public expectations.
There is a strong public mandate for AI regulation 
to mitigate the societal risks and negative 
impacts of AI: Seventy percent of people believe 
AI regulation is required, including the majority 
in almost all countries surveyed. This broad 
public consensus on the need for regulation 
supports national and international efforts in many 
jurisdictions to develop and implement regulatory 
and governance frameworks to support the safe 
and responsible use of AI.
However, the current regulatory landscape is 
falling short of public expectations: only two in 
five believe that the existing laws and regulation 
governing AI systems in their country are 
adequate. Most people are unaware of laws, 
legislation or government policy that apply to AI. 
These findings reflect that most countries 
and jurisdictions are still in an early stage 
of designing or implementing regulatory 
approaches. While some countries have adaptive 
legislation that may apply to AI (e.g. consumer 
or privacy laws), such laws are absent or weakly 
enforced in some jurisdictions. This suggests 
the need to clarify, develop or strengthen such 
legislation where it is lacking and to educate 
and raise public awareness of applicable laws. 
The importance of effective, fit-for-purpose 
regulation—and awareness of such regulation—
is underscored by our finding that the perceived 
adequacy of AI regulation is a key predictor of 
trust and acceptance of AI systems.
The majority of people expect a multipronged 
national and international regulatory approach 
to AI, with international laws and regulation the 
most endorsed form of regulation and supported 
by a clear majority in all countries. National 
government regulation or a co-regulatory 
approach between government and industry is 
preferred in most countries over self-regulation 
by industry or an independent AI regulator. 
This highlights the public’s expectation that 
government takes a central role in ensuring 
effective governance and regulation of AI, as 
well as the expectation that industry will work 
with regulatory bodies and proactively align 
their governance approach with the evolving 
regulatory landscape.

There is also a clear mandate for stronger 
regulation of AI-generated misinformation: 
87 percent of respondents want laws to combat 
AI-generated misinformation and expect social 
media and media companies to implement 
stronger fact-checking processes and methods 
that enable people to detect AI-generated 
content. Our findings indicate that AI generated 
misinformation is a key concern globally and is 
undermining trust in online content and raising 
concerns about the integrity of elections. 
AI literacy is lagging AI adoption yet is 
critical for responsible and effective use
Although AI tools are being widely used by the 
public, employees and students, AI literacy 
remains limited; about half of respondents say 
they don’t feel they understand AI nor when or 
how it is used. Half of respondents are unaware 
that AI underpins common applications such as 
social media, despite 90 percent saying they 
use such platforms. This knowledge gap reflects 
that only two in five people report any AI-related 
training or education.
Despite low rates of knowledge and training, 
three in five say they can use AI effectively. 
This likely reflects the easily accessible 
interfaces of many AI systems (e.g. using 
natural language) and low barriers to use. 
While this accessibility has benefits, it also 
risks fostering complacency and overreliance 
if not accompanied by meaningful levels of 
understanding and literacy.
AI literacy is higher in emerging economies, 
where three-quarters believe they can use 
AI effectively, compared to half in advanced 
economies, and half report AI training or education 
compared to a third in advanced economies. 
AI literacy consistently emerges in our findings 
as a cross-cutting enabler: it is associated with 
greater use, trust, acceptance, and critical 
engagement, and more realized benefits from 
AI use including more performance benefits in 
the workplace. 
The pattern of findings underscores that AI 
literacy and training in responsible use is not only 
a personal skillset, but can also be a strategic 
capability for organizations and societies alike, 
enabling people to recognize and seize the 
capabilities of AI while recognizing their limitations 
and guarding against harm. Investing in AI literacy 
is a critical component of ensuring AI is used 
safely, ethically, and to its full potential.
There are notable differences between 
countries with advanced and emerging 
economies: People in emerging 
economies report greater trust, 
acceptance and adoption of AI, higher 
levels of AI literacy, and more realized 
benefits from AI
One of the most striking insights from the survey 
is the stark contrast in use, trust, and attitudes 
toward AI between people in advanced and 
emerging economies. 
People in emerging economies report higher 
adoption and use of AI both at work and for 
personal purposes, are more trusting and 
accepting of AI, and feel more positive about 
its use. They report higher levels of AI training 
and literacy, are more likely to expect and 
realize the benefits of AI, and view AI benefits 
as outweighing the risks. They are also more 
confident in the development and use of AI by 
commercial organizations and big technology 
companies and more likely to view current 
AI regulation and safeguards as adequate, 
compared to people in advanced economies. 
These differences hold even when controlling 
for the effects of age and education. 
These findings suggest that many countries 
with emerging economies are leading the 
way in terms of AI adoption.7 In particular, six 
countries with emerging economies strongly 
and consistently show this pattern—India, China, 
Nigeria, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Of the 
advanced economies, Norway, Israel, Singapore, 
Switzerland and Latvia have comparatively high 
levels of AI adoption, trust, acceptance, and 
positive attitudes toward AI.

An implication is that these countries may 
be uniquely positioned to rapidly accelerate 
innovation and technological advantage through 
AI. This has implications for global competitive 
dynamics and may create shifts in the economic 
landscape across countries in the future as AI 
becomes a more prominent driver of productivity 
and economic activity. 
Pathways to support the trusted and 
responsible adoption of AI 
Our modeling supports four distinct yet 
complementary pathways to trusted and 
sustained AI adoption: a knowledge pathway 
reflecting the importance of supporting people’s 
AI literacy and efficacy through AI training and 
education; a motivational pathway reflecting 
the importance of deploying AI in a human-
centric way that delivers benefits to people; 
the uncertainty reduction pathway reflecting 
the need to address concerns about the risks 
associated with AI, and an institutional pathway 
reflecting the adequacy of current safeguards, 
regulation and laws to promote safe AI use, 
and confidence in entities to develop and use 
AI in the public interest. 
Of these drivers, the institutional pathway 
had the strongest influence on trust, followed 
by the motivational pathway. This model also 
holds at the organizational level where the 
institutional pathway reflects appropriate levels 
of organizational governance, strategy, and 
training to support AI and its responsible use.
AI adoption has increased markedly 
since 2022, but trust in AI has declined 
and worry has increased
Our research program provided the unique 
opportunity to compare data from the current 
survey with our previous survey data collected from 
17 countries in late 2022, just prior to the release 
of ChatGPT. This comparison revealed a trend 
of less positive attitudes toward AI, as adoption 
has increased.
As expected, adoption of AI in the workplace 
increased dramatically in all 17 countries: employee 
reported organizational use of AI increased from 
34 percent to 71 percent, and employees’ use of AI 
at work increased from 54 percent to 67 percent. 
The largest increases occurred in Australia, 
Canada, the USA, and the UK. 
However, this increased adoption is coupled with a 
trend toward people feeling more concerned about 
and less trusting of AI. People’s perceptions of the 
trustworthiness of AI systems and their willingness 
to rely on AI declined in most countries, as did 
employee trust of AI at work in some countries. 
This decline in trust likely reflects that increased 
use and exposure, particularly to general-purpose 
generative AI tools, has increased awareness of 
both the capabilities and benefits of these tools, 
and also their limitations and potential negative 
impacts (e.g. hallucinations), prompting more 
considered trust and reliance. 
More people report feeling worried about AI 
and concerned about the risks, and fewer view 
the benefits of AI as outweighing the risks. For 
example, in Brazil half of people reported feeling 
worried about AI in 2022 compared to 75% in 
2024, and the view that the benefits of AI outweigh 
the risks fell from 71% to 44%. Excitement also 
dampened over this time in several countries. 
With this increase in concern, the importance of 
organizational assurance mechanisms as a basis 
for trust increased in all countries, suggesting 
a greater need for reassurance that AI is being 
used in a trustworthy and responsible way. 
Attitudes toward the regulation of AI remained 
stable and there was no overall change to the 
perceived adequacy of regulation and laws.
Despite the rapid uptake of AI, we found no 
discernible change in the public’s self-reported 
understanding of AI, or their objective awareness 
of AI use in common applications. 
This pattern of findings suggests that the hype 
of AI may be giving way to a more realistic and 
measured assessment of AI’s capabilities and 
limitations, benefits and risks, and heightened need 
for reassurance around the trustworthy deployment 
of AI and proactive mitigation of AI risks.
Collectively, the survey insights provide 
evidence-based pathways for strengthening the 
responsible use of AI systems and the trusted 
adoption of AI in society and work. These 
insights are relevant for informing responsible 
AI strategy, practice and policy within business, 
government, and education at a national level, 
as well as informing AI guidelines, policy 
and regulation at the international and pan-
governmental level.

This is the fourth survey in our program of 
research examining public trust and attitudes 
toward AI. Our current report examines the 
perspectives of over 48,000 people from 
47 countries covering all global geographic 
regions, using nationally representative 
sampling of the adult population based on 
age, gender, and regional distribution. Taking 
a global perspective is crucial, given that AI 
systems are not bound by physical borders 
and are rapidly being deployed and used 
across the world. 
Our program of research provided the unique 
opportunity to benchmark and compare the 
findings in this report to our previous survey 
data collected from 17 countries in late 2022, 
just prior to the release of ChatGPT. We 
examine changes in public trust and attitudes 
over time in these 17 countries and highlight 
changes where relevant throughout the report 
(see ‘How we conducted the research’ for 
more details). 
Introduction
The motivation for this research is to provide an evidence-based understanding 
of public trust, attitudes, and experiences of AI, and expectations of its 
governance and regulation, as a resource to inform public policy and industry 
and government practice. 
Given the rapid advancement, widespread deployment and transformative 
impact of AI technologies, it is important to regularly examine public trust, 
attitudes, and expectations of AI. Equally important is documenting how 
people use AI technologies and experience the impacts of AI in their lives, 
work, and studies, and the implications this may have for organizations, 
education providers, and society at large. To date, there has been limited 
empirical insight addressing these critical issues, underscoring the relevance 
of this research in promoting human-centered AI that meets evolving 
societal needs and expectations. 
The Trust in AI 
Research Program
This study is the fourth in a research 
program examining public trust in 
AI. Each study has been designed 
to uphold academic rigor and 
independence, whilst leveraging the 
deep multidisciplinary expertise and 
insight from KPMG. The first focused 
on Australians’ trust in AI in 2020, the 
second expanded the research scope 
to study trust in five countries in 2021, 
and the third surveyed people in 
17 countries in 2022.

Our research insights are structured in three 
sections. The first focuses on AI use broadly in 
society examining the public’s use, understanding, 
trust, attitudes and experience of AI systems and 
their impact on society. These insights are based 
on all respondents answering survey questions 
asked about AI systems in general, as well as AI 
use in the context of three common applications 
which are likely to be used by or impact many 
people: generative AI systems, AI in healthcare, 
and AI in Human Resource applications. 
In the second section, we delve deeper 
into understanding how employees use and 
experience AI impacts in the workplace. In the 
third section, we examine student use of AI and 
their perceptions of how AI impacts education. 
Together, these sections provide evidence-based 
insights on the following questions:
•	 To what extent do people use and understand 
AI systems? 
•	 To what extent do people trust and accept 
AI systems?
•	 How do people view and experience the 
benefits and risks of AI? 
•	 What do people expect from the regulation 
and governance of AI? 
•	 What are the key drivers of AI trust and

How the 
research was
conducted
48,340 
people completed the survey 
across 47 countries and 
jurisdictions, covering all 
global geographical regions8: 
1.	 North America (Canada, United 
States of America [USA])
2.	 Latin America and Caribbean 
(Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, 
Costa Rica, Mexico)
3.	 Northern and Western Europe 
(Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, 
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, 
Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, 
United Kingdom [UK])
4.	 Southern Europe (Greece, Italy, 
Portugal, Slovenia, Spain)
5.	 Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia)
6.	 Africa (Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa)
7.	 Western Asia (Israel, Saudi Arabia, 
Türkiye, United Arab Emirates [UAE])
8.	 Eastern, Southern and Central Asia 
(China,9 , India, Japan, Republic of 
Korea, Singapore)
9.	 Oceania (Australia, New Zealand)
How the data was collected 
Data was collected in each country between 
November 2024 and mid-January 2025 using 
an online survey. 
Countries were selected based on three criteria: 
1) representation across global regions;
2) leadership in AI activity and readiness,10 and 
3) diversity on the Responsible AI Index.11 
The sample size in each country ranged from 
1,001 to 1,098 respondents. 
Analysis of the data revealed a distinct pattern 
of findings across countries with emerging 
and advanced economies. We adopted the 
International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) classification 
of advanced and emerging economies. The 
emerging economies surveyed are Argentina, 
Brazil, Chile, China,12 Colombia, Costa Rica, 
Egypt, Hungary, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Poland, 
Romania, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Türkiye,
and UAE.
Surveys were conducted in the native language(s) 
of each country with the option to complete 
in English, if preferred. To ensure question 
equivalence across countries, surveys were 
professionally translated and back translated 
from English to each respective language, using 
separate translators. See Appendix 1 for further 
method details.

Who completed the survey?
Representative research panels were used 
to ensure the people who completed the 
survey are representative of the population.13
This approach is common in survey research. 
Samples were nationally representative of 
the adult population on gender, age and regional 
distribution matched against official national 
statistics. In select countries, full representation 
on these criteria was not obtainable (see Appendix 2 
for further details on country sampling). 
Across the total sample, the gender balance 
was 51 percent women, 49 percent men and 
<1 percent other gender identities. The mean age 
was 46 years and ranged between 18 and 95 years. 
Half the sample (51%) had a university education 
and 20 percent a vocational or trade qualification. 
The sample represented the full range of income 
levels, with the majority (72%) reporting middle 
incomes (see Appendix 1 for details of the 
income measure).14
Sixty-seven percent of respondents were currently 
working full-time or part-time. These respondents 
represented the diversity of industries and 
occupational groups listed by the OECD and 
International Labor Organization15 and included 
employees of small, medium, and large organizations, 
business owners, and people who were self-
employed (e.g. sole traders and freelancers).
Five percent of respondents were students, with 
the majority tertiary students enrolled in university 
education (65%) or a vocational, trade or technical 
program (16%), and the remainder in secondary 
education (18%).
Further details of the sample representativeness, 
including the demographic profile for each country 
sample, are shown in Appendix 2.

How we asked about AI
After asking a series of questions about 
respondents’ understanding of AI, the following 
description of AI, adapted from the OECD 
definition,16 was provided: Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) refers to machine-based systems that infer 
from the input they receive and objectives 
provided, how to generate outputs such as 
predictions, content, recommendations, or 
decisions. Different AI systems vary in their 
levels of autonomy and adaptiveness.
As attitudes toward AI systems may depend on 
their purpose and use, survey questions that 
asked about the use of AI systems in society 
referred to one of four AI use cases (randomly 
allocated, see below): Generative AI (used 
to create output and content in response to 
user prompts); Healthcare AI (used to inform 
decisions about how to diagnose and treat 
patients); Human Resources AI (used to inform 
decisions about hiring and promotion); and AI 
systems in general.
These use cases were selected to represent 
AI applications that are widely and increasingly 
used and can impact many people, and were 
developed based on expert input. Respondents 
were provided with a description of the AI 
use case allocated to them, before answering 
questions related to AI systems.
Generative AI
A form of AI used to create 
content such as text, 
images, audio, and video 
based on user prompts. It 
works by processing these 
prompts and generating 
new content based on 
patterns and structures it 
has learned from extensive 
amounts of data. People 
use generative AI for a 
wide range of applications, 
such as writing, 
programming, personalized 
education, administrative 
support, product design 
and development, 
forecasting, and creating 
art and music.
Human Resources AI
An AI system used to help 
select the most suitable 
applicants for a job, 
identify employees who 
are most likely to perform 
well in a job, and predict 
who is most likely to quit. 
It works by collecting 
and comparing worker 
characteristics, employee 
data, and performance over 
time, and analyzing which 
qualities are related to 
better job performance and 
job retention. Managers 
use Human Resources AI 
to inform decisions about 
hiring and promotion.
Healthcare AI
An AI system used to 
improve the diagnosis 
of disease (e.g. cancer), 
inform the best treatment 
options, and predict health 
outcomes based on patient 
data. It works by comparing 
a patient’s health data (e.g. 
symptoms, test and scan 
results, medical history, 
family history, age, weight 
and gender, etc.) to large 
datasets based on many 
patients. Doctors use 
Healthcare AI to inform 
decisions about patient 
diagnosis and treatment.

How the data was analyzed
Statistical analyses were conducted to examine 
differences between countries and economic 
groups (e.g. countries with advanced and 
emerging economies, as classified by the 
IMF), and demographic factors (e.g. gender, 
age, education, income, occupation). Relevant 
differences are reported when statistically 
significant and meaningful. Correlational analyses 
and statistical models indicate associations 
between concepts and do not infer causality. 
Further details of the statistical procedures are 
discussed in Appendix 1. An overview of key 
indicators for each country sample are shown 
in Appendix 3.
How changes in trust, use and attitudes 
over time were assessed 
To understand how trust, use, and attitudes 
toward AI have shifted over time, a selection 
of questions was asked in the same way in 
the 2022 and 2024 surveys.
The 2022 survey included 17 countries: 
Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Estonia, 
Finland, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, 
Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, Korea, 
the UK, and the USA.17
While the samples collected in 2022 and 2024 
are based on the same methodology and sample 
representativeness, they are independent of each 
other. As such, our analyses examine general 
trends rather than a longitudinal analysis of the 
same respondents over time. Relevant insights 
on these changes are highlighted in call-out 
boxes throughout the report (for an overview, 
see Appendix 4).

Public attitudes 
towards AI
SECTION ONE
In this first section, we examine the public’s adoption and 
understanding of AI and their trust, acceptance, and emotions 
towards the use of AI systems in society. We explore people’s 
expectations and experience of positive and negative impacts 
from AI systems, how they view the benefits relative to the risks, 
and expectations of AI regulation and governance. We test a 
model identifying key predictors of AI trust and acceptance and 
explore how people from various demographic groups differ in 
their attitudes toward and use of AI.

To what extent do people use 
and understand AI systems? 
To contextualize the findings and provide an indicator of overall public 
adoption of AI and AI literacy levels, we first examine people’s use and 
understanding of AI systems and how this varies across countries. 
To identify levels of AI literacy, survey participants self-reported their 
level of AI knowledge and efficacy together with AI-related education 
and training. They were also asked about their objective understanding 
of AI use in common technologies and interest in learning more about AI.
In subsequent sections of the report, employees’ and students’ use of AI 
at work and for educational purposes are examined in more detail, together 
with organizational support for AI literacy.
Public adoption of AI is high: Two in 
three people report intentional regular 
use of AI tools for either personal, 
work, or study purposes
People were asked to report how often 
they intentionally use AI tools, clarifying 
that this use is different from the passive 
use of AI (e.g. when AI operates behind 
the scenes in tools such as email filters 
and search engines).
Two thirds of people (66%) report 
intentionally using AI on a regular basis 
for personal, work, or study reasons. As 
shown in Figure 1, two in five (38%) people 
report using AI on a weekly or daily basis, 
whereas just over a quarter (28%) use AI 
semi-regularly (i.e. every month or every 
few months). One-third (34%) rarely or 
never intentionally use AI. 
Three in five (59%) use AI at least semi-
regularly for personal purposes, with those 
not working or studying much less likely to 
use AI (only 37%). Three in five (58%) people 
who work intentionally use AI regularly for 
work purposes, while four in five (83%) 
students regularly use AI in their studies. 
This high level of adoption reflects the 
ease with which AI systems—particularly 
general-purpose generative AI tools—can 
be accessed and used by a diverse range 
of people and applied to a broad variety of 
tasks. This sets AI apart from many other 
advanced technologies that have greater 
barriers and constraints on access and 
use by individuals. 
38%
of people report 
using AI on a weekly 
or daily basis.

There are notable differences across 
countries in people’s adoption of AI, with 
emerging economies leading the way
There is a distinct pattern of findings between 
countries with advanced and emerging 
economies, with the use of AI tools notably 
higher in countries with emerging economies. 
On average, four in five (80%) people in emerging 
economies intentionally use AI tools on a regular 
or semi-regular basis, compared to three in five 
(58%) in advanced economies.
As shown in Figure 2, levels of AI use in most 
emerging economies exceed 70 percent of the 
population, with India and Nigeria reporting the 
highest regular or semi-regular usage (92%). Two 
emerging economies located in Eastern Europe—
Hungary and Romania—have notably lower AI 
use compared to the other emerging economies.
In contrast, AI use levels in most advanced 
economies fall below 70 percent of the population, 
with the lowest usage reported in the Netherlands 
(43%) and the highest in Singapore (73%).

Most people have no AI training and half 
don’t feel they understand AI, yet 3 in 5 
believe they can use AI effectively
Despite high levels of adoption, the majority of 
people report they have not received any form of 
AI training or education. Only two in five (39%) 
report some form of AI training, such as work-
based AI training, formal or informal AI training 
outside of work, or completing a university-level 
course related to AI (such as computer science 
or data analytics; see Figure 3).
In line with these low levels of AI training, 
almost half (48%) report limited knowledge 
about AI, indicating that they do not feel they 
understand AI nor when or how it is used.18 
As shown in Figure 4, only one in five people 
report high levels of knowledge, and about a 
third report a moderate level.
Despite low levels of AI education, training and 
knowledge, 60 percent of people believe they 
can use AI effectively. This includes their ability to 
choose, use and communicate with AI systems 
to support everyday activities, and evaluate the 
accuracy of AI output (see Figure 5). This is likely 
because many AI tools and systems are designed 
to be intuitive to use and accessible to a broad 
range of people (via a mobile phone application, 
for example, and by using natural language to 
make requests), enabling these tools to be used 
widely with limited or no training. For example, AI 
voice assistants can be used simply by conversing 
with these tools.

AI training, knowledge, and efficacy 
are lowest in the advanced economies
In line with the distinct differences in the use 
of AI across economic groups, there are also 
pronounced differences between advanced and 
emerging economies when it comes to levels of 
AI training, knowledge, and efficacy. 
As shown in Figure 6, half of the people surveyed 
in emerging economies report having completed 
AI-related training or education, compared 
to less than a third in advanced economies. 
Similarly, almost two-thirds of people in emerging 
economies report moderate or high knowledge 
about AI, compared to less than half in advanced 
economies. Around three-quarters of those in the 
emerging economies feel they can use AI tools 
and systems effectively, compared to only half in 
advanced economies.

A third are unaware that AI enables 
common applications they use: half 
don’t know AI is used in social media
As an indicator of people’s objective awareness 
of AI use, respondents were asked if they use 
the three common technologies shown in Figure 
8, and whether these technologies are enabled 
by AI (i.e. whether these technologies rely on 
AI to function). Seventy-nine percent of people 
use these common AI-enabled technologies—
highlighting the prevalence of AI technologies 
in people’s lives—but over a third (36%) are 
unaware that these technologies use AI. 
Use of the technology does not necessarily 
translate into an increased understanding of 
whether AI is part of it. For example, while the 
Self-reported understanding of AI has not changed over time and many are still 
unaware that AI is used in common applications like social media 
Despite the rapid uptake of AI since 2022, there has been no overall substantive change in self-
reported knowledge of AI (M=2.6 in 2022; M=2.6 in 2024). However, increases were found in 
four countries, Estonia, Brazil, China and South Africa, with the largest increases in Estonia (26% 
vs. 50%, M=2.1 vs. 2.8) and Brazil (38% vs. 63%, M=2.5 vs. 3.0).
Although use of AI in common technologies such as social media, facial recognition, and virtual 
assistants has tended to remain constant or increased in most countries, many are still unaware that 
these technologies rely on AI to function. For example, social media use has remained constant and 
high over time across countries (88% use at both time points), yet many are still unaware that 
AI is used in social media platforms (2022: 44% vs. 2024: 46%).

majority (90%) of the sample reports using social

Figure 8, this pattern of using technology without 
realizing it relies on AI is particularly strong for 
social media, but also evident in facial recognition 
and virtual assistants—prompting the question of 
whether the awareness of AI’s central role in these 
technologies would change how people engage 
with them.
People in emerging economies are more likely 
to be aware that AI is used in these technologies 
than those in advanced countries (70% vs. 
61%), and they are also more likely to use these 
common AI-enabled technologies (88% vs. 74%).

Four in five want to learn more about 
AI, with interest highest in emerging 
economies
Most people (83%) are interested in learning 
more about AI, ranging from almost all (97%) 
in Nigeria to three in five (59%) in Australia. 
In most emerging economies, over 90 percent 
of people express a desire to learn more about 
AI. In contrast, respondents in seven advanced 
economies (Australia, New Zealand, the USA, 
Canada, the UK, Japan and Finland) have 
considerably lower interest (ranging from 59-
67%), compared to other countries. Australia 
and Finland are notably low, with two in five 
(41%) people reporting no or low interest in 
learning more about AI. 
In summary
Taken together, these findings indicate high rates of AI adoption by the 
public, coupled with comparably low levels of AI training and literacy. Low 
levels of AI literacy may limit people’s ability to recognize the capabilities 
and applications of AI and thus fully realize benefits, and importantly, the 
ability to recognize the limitations of AI systems, critically evaluate their 
outputs, and guard against harm. For instance, social media users that 
are unaware of how algorithms shape content may fail to question the 
credibility or biases of algorithmically curated content and face increased 
vulnerability to misinformation and manipulation. 
The findings also reveal accelerated uptake of AI tools and higher levels 
of AI literacy amongst people in emerging economies compared to 
advanced economies. This may be explained in part by the increasingly 
important role that emerging and transformative technologies play in 
the economic development of these countries.19 As discussed in the 
next sections, people in emerging economies also tend to be more 
trusting, accepting, and positive about AI and experience the most 
benefits from its use, compared to those in advanced economies.
In most emerging 
economies, over
90%
of people express a desire 
to learn more about AI 
People with AI knowledge and efficacy tend 
to be more interested in learning more about 
AI (r=.48), suggesting a virtuous cycle where 
those who are already knowledgeable and 
confident in using AI are more eager to 
learn and thus more likely to deepen their 
understanding further. In contrast, those 
with low knowledge and efficacy may fall 
further behind.

To what extent do people trust 
and accept AI systems?
To answer this question, respondents were asked about their trust and 
acceptance of a range of AI systems, and the extent to which they perceive 
them to be trustworthy. They were also asked about the emotions they feel 
when it comes to AI applications.
Our approach to measuring trust in AI aligns with the following common 
definition of trust: a willingness to be vulnerable to an AI system (e.g. by 
relying on system recommendations or output or sharing personal data) 
based on positive expectations of how the system will operate (such as 
accuracy, helpfulness, data privacy and security).20 
People have more trust in the technical 
ability of AI systems to provide a helpful 
service but are more skeptical of its 
safety, security and impact on people
While most people use AI tools, many people 
have reservations about the trustworthiness of 
AI systems and their use in society. 
On average, 58 percent of people view AI 
systems as trustworthy.21 People have more faith 
in the technical ability of AI systems to provide 
accurate and reliable output and services (65%) 
than in their safety, security, impact on people, 
and ethical soundness (e.g. that they are fair, 
do no harm, and uphold privacy rights; 52%).
This difference is consistent across countries, 
as shown in Figure 9. To illustrate, in Finland—a 
country where trustworthiness is very low—half 
of the respondents view AI systems as providing 
a helpful service, yet only a third agree that 
these systems are safe and secure to use. By 
contrast, in Egypt—where AI is perceived as highly 
trustworthy—83 percent believe AI systems are 
accurate and provide a helpful service, while 72 
percent agree that they are safe and secure to use.
Trust is important because it underpins the 
acceptance and sustained adoption of AI. 
This is confirmed by our research: trust is 
associated with the acceptance and approval 
of AI systems (r=.70) and the use of AI (r=.48). 
People who trust AI systems are more likely 
to use them frequently.
How trust in AI was measured
To understand how people view the 
trustworthiness of AI systems, we asked about 
two key components: the technical ability of AI 
(e.g. to provide accurate and reliable output and a 
helpful service), and safe and ethical use (e.g. to 
be safe and secure to use and ethically sound).
We also examined two primary ways people 
demonstrate trust in AI systems: Reliance 
assesses people’s willingness to rely on an AI 
system’s output, such as a recommendation 
or decision (i.e. to trust that it is accurate). 
Information sharing relates to the willingness 
to share information or data with an AI system 
(e.g. to provide personal information to enable 
the system to work or perform a service).

Most people are ambivalent or unwilling 
to trust AI systems but accept their use
The concern about the safety and security of AI 
and its impact on people helps explain why a little 
over half (54%) of people are wary about trusting 
AI systems, reporting either ambivalence or an 
unwillingness to trust (see Figure 10). Only 46 
percent are willing to trust AI systems.
As people’s trust in AI may vary depending on the 
application of AI, we asked about trust in different 
AI use cases. As shown in Figure 10, there are 
similar levels of trust in generative AI tools, AI use 
in Human Resources, and AI systems in general 
(42-45% are willing to trust, Ms=3.9-4.0). 
One difference is that people are more trusting 
of AI use in healthcare (52% willing, M=4.3), 
with healthcare the most trusted application in 
42 of the 47 countries surveyed (see Figure 11). 
This difference likely reflects the direct benefit 
that increased precision of medical diagnoses 
and treatments affords people, combined 
with generally high levels of trust in medical 
professionals in most countries.22 These findings 
reinforce that people’s trust of AI systems is 
contextual and can depend on the use case 
and their confidence in the organization that is 
deploying the AI system. 
Most people report low or moderate acceptance 
and approval of the use of AI systems (see 
Figure 10), with moderate acceptance indicating 
a level of ambivalence in their acceptance of AI 
use. In contrast, a third report high acceptance 
and approval. Taken together, these findings 
show that the majority (72%) have at least some 
level of acceptance of AI use.

Trust and acceptance of AI is lower in 
advanced economies
As shown in Figure 12, trust and acceptance of 
AI systems are consistently lower in advanced 
economies compared to emerging economies. 
In advanced economies, two in five are willing to 
trust AI systems by relying on their output and 
sharing information with these systems. Half view 
AI systems as trustworthy, and two-thirds report 
at least moderate levels of acceptance. 
In contrast, people in emerging economies have 
more trust in AI systems, view them as more 
trustworthy, and have higher levels of acceptance 
and approval of their use. It is notable, however, 
that 43 percent of people in emerging economies 
remain ambivalent or unwilling to trust AI 
systems, highlighting that trust cannot be taken 
for granted.
To illustrate this distinction at the country level, 
as shown in Figure 13, over half of the people 
surveyed trust AI systems in 12 of the 17 
emerging economies (ranging from 
41 percent in Poland to 79 percent in Nigeria). 
Trust and acceptance are particularly high in the 
six emerging economies of Nigeria, India, Egypt, 
China, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—with over 
60 percent of people willing to trust AI and at 
least 49 percent reporting high acceptance. 
These countries also have the highest levels 
of AI use and AI literacy, as previously reported.
In contrast, less than half trust AI systems in 25 
of the 29 advanced economies. Of the advanced 
economies, trust is highest in Norway,23 Spain, 
Israel, and Singapore (all over 50 percent willing 
to trust). In contrast, Finland and Japan rate the 
lowest on trust (25-28%) while New Zealand and 
Australia (15-17% high acceptance) rank lowest 
on acceptance. 
The higher trust and acceptance of AI in emerging 
economies is reflected in the accelerated uptake 
of AI in these countries.24

People have mixed emotions about AI: 
both optimism and worry prevail
People feel a range of emotions about AI 
applications. As shown in Figure 14, the majority 
feel optimistic and excited, while also worried— 
demonstrating a degree of emotional ambivalence.
People in emerging economies report more 
positive emotions toward AI and a clear 
divergence between positive and negative 
sentiment. Optimism and excitement are 
dominant emotions in emerging economies, 
experienced by 74-82 percent of people. 
Significantly fewer (56%) feel worried.
In contrast, people in advanced economies feel 
both worried and optimistic in almost equal 
measure (61-64%), with just over half (51%) 
feeling excited.
Each emotion was measured on a 5-point scale, with the above ﬁgure displaying % Moderate to High = ‘Moderately’, 
‘Very’ or ‘Extremely’

are excited. In contrast, over 80 percent of people

At least half of respondents feel worried about 
AI in all but three countries, underscoring that 
worry about AI often coexists with optimism 
and excitement in many countries.
Reinforcing this pattern, Figure 15 shows 
emotions about AI applications at the country 
level. People in many advanced economies feel 
more worried than optimistic or excited, whereas 
optimism and excitement dominate in most 
emerging economies. To illustrate, 70 percent of 
people in Japan feel worried and only 37 percent

Trust in AI systems has decreased 
over time and worry has increased
The perceived trustworthiness of AI systems 
decreased over time from 63 percent of people 
viewing AI systems as trustworthy in 2022 
to 56 percent in 2024 (M=4.8 vs. M=4.6; 
see Figure 16). This demonstrates that many 
are feeling less positive about the ability of 
AI systems to provide accurate and reliable 
output, and be safe, secure and ethical to use. 
Perceived trustworthiness decreased in 13 of the 
17 countries, with the largest decreases in Israel 
(68% to 52%) and South Africa (76% vs. 62%).
Similarly, people’s willingness to rely on AI 
systems decreased on average from 52 percent 
in 2022 to 43 percent in 2024 (M=4.3 vs. 
M=4.0; see Figure 16), with decreases in 12 of 
the 17 countries. The largest decreases occurred 
in Japan (43% to 21%) and Brazil (67% to 53%). 
This likely reflects that with increased use and 
exposure to AI systems, people have become more 
aware of their capabilities and limitations, prompting 
a more considered reliance on these tools. 
Over this same period, there is a striking increase 
in the number of people feeling worried about 
AI systems, rising from almost half (49%) of 
respondents in 2022 to 62 percent in 2024 (M=2.4 
to M=3.0). This increase was found in 15 of the 
17 countries, with the largest increases in Brazil 
(49% in 2022 vs. 75% in 2024) together with 
Israel, Estonia, the Netherlands and Finland 
(ranging from 21-26% increase in worry).
In 11 of the 17 countries, people also feel less 
excited about AI systems, with the largest 
difference in France, where just 35 percent feel 
excited about AI in 2024 (M=2.0) compared to 
58 percent in 2022 (M=2.6). The only country 
where excitement increased is Korea, where 
75 percent report feeling excited in 2024, compared 
to 57 percent in 2022 (M=3.2 vs. M=2.5).

In summary
Overall, the findings reveal considerable ambivalence toward the use 
of AI systems in society, stemming from the tension that people are 
less trusting of the safety and security of using AI systems and their 
impact on society, but are more trusting of their technical ability to 
provide a helpful service. This tension is reflected in low and ambivalent 
trust of AI, moderate acceptance, and the coexistence of optimism with 
worry, particularly for people in advanced economies. Moreover, trust in 
AI has declined over time, while worry has increased. The next section 
examines how this ambivalent trust is shaped by perceptions and 
experiences of the benefits and risks of AI systems.

How do people view and experience 
the benefits and risks of AI?
To help answer this question, we asked the extent to which people perceive 
and have observed or experienced beneficial or negative outcomes from AI, 
and if they feel the benefits of AI applications outweigh the risks.
People expect and are experiencing 
a broad range of benefits from AI 
Most people (83%) believe the use of AI will 
result in a wide range of benefits, as shown 
in Figure 17. Importantly, 73 percent of people 
are personally experiencing or observing 
these benefits.25
The most commonly expected benefits are 
also some of the most realized, with over three 
quarters reporting they have experienced or 
observed improved efficiency and effectiveness, 
reduced time spent on mundane or repetitive 
tasks and improved levels of accessibility to 
information or services.26 Increased fairness 
due to the use of AI (e.g. by reducing human 
bias) is the least commonly realized benefit, 
but it is still experienced or observed by over 
half of respondents (54%).
The utility of AI and people’s lived experience 
of its benefits help explain the widespread 
use, adoption and qualified acceptance of 
AI technologies, despite the trust concerns. 
The positive benefits experienced are largely 
performance oriented—in line with our finding 
that people are more trusting of AI’s ability to 
provide a helpful service and output.
People who expect and experience or observe 
benefits from AI are more likely to trust (r=.42-
.57), accept (r=.41-.63), and use AI (r=.40-.41). 
They are also more likely to have AI training or 
education (r=.25), AI knowledge (r=.31-.38), 
and AI efficacy (r=.38-.45).
73%
are personally experiencing 
or observing benefits of AI.

People in emerging economies are 
more likely to expect and realize the 
benefits of AI
Ninety percent of people in emerging economies 
expect benefits from AI applications, compared 
to 79 percent in advanced economies. As shown 
in Figure 18, people in emerging economies have 
the most positive expectations of the benefits of 
AI. For instance, 95 percent of people in Nigeria 
expect a wide range of benefits. In contrast, fewer 
people expect benefits from AI in several advanced 
economies, particularly Australia, Canada, Finland, 
Japan, New Zealand, the UK and the USA.
The majority of people in emerging economies are 
also more likely to have observed or experienced 
AI benefits (82% vs. 65% in advanced economies). 
The largest differences between economies relate 
to the benefits of increased fairness (66% vs 43%), 
enhanced creativity (80% vs 59%), and improved 
outcomes for people (84% vs 64%).
AI systems may be perceived and experienced as 
more beneficial in emerging economies because 
of their ability to fill critical resource gaps and 
provide greater relative opportunities to people. 
For instance, the use of AI systems in healthcare 
has the potential to enhance service delivery and 
improve health outcomes in areas where there is 
limited access to medical professionals.

People are concerned about a range of 
negative outcomes from AI use and two in 
five are experiencing negative outcomes
While many of those surveyed are experiencing 
significant benefits from AI use, the majority 
(79%) are also concerned about a broad range 
of risks and negative outcomes from AI use (see 
Figure 20). Many of these risks are at the societal 
level, impacting society broadly rather than having 
isolated impacts on the individuals who use AI.27 
Cybersecurity risk (e.g. from hacking or malware) 
is a dominant concern raised by 85 percent 
of people, together with the loss of human 
interaction and connection (e.g. losing the option 
to speak with a human service provider). Other 
risks raised by over 80 percent of people include 
misinformation and disinformation (e.g. AI used 
to spread misleading or false information and 
deepfakes), manipulation or harmful use, loss 
of privacy or intellectual property (IP), deskilling 
and dependency, and job loss. 
In comparison, people are less concerned about 
the risk of bias or unfair treatment from AI use 
or the environmental impact (68-69%). This may 
reflect a lack of awareness of the potential for AI 
systems to codify existing biases in datasets, and 
the high energy usage required to develop some 
AI systems and power the data centers they rely 
on. Although the percentages are lower, bias and 
environmental impact remain clear concerns for 
more than two thirds of people.
In addition to being concerned about the risks 
of AI applications, two in five have personally 
experienced or observed these negative 
outcomes (43%; see Figure 20). The loss of 
human interaction and connection, inaccurate 
outcomes, and misinformation and disinformation 
are the most commonly experienced negative 
outcomes from AI (52-55%). Bias or unfair 
treatment is the least commonly experienced or 
observed outcome, but it was still experienced 
by almost a third of people.

The risks of AI are viewed and experienced 
in a comparable way across countries
In contrast to the differences across countries in 
how people view the benefits of AI, there are few 
differences across countries in people’s concerns 
about the risks: the same proportion of people 
are concerned about negative outcomes from AI 
in both advanced and emerging economies (79% 
and 78%, respectively) and the majority of people 
in all countries report moderate or high concern 
about these risks (ranging from 67% in China to 
87% in Greece). 
As shown in Figure 21, the top concerns in 
almost all countries are either cybersecurity risks 
or the loss of human connection. China, Egypt, 
Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and South Africa are the 
exceptions, where job loss is the primary or an 
equal concern. There are also commonalities in 
what people are least concerned about, with 
either the environmental impacts of AI or the 
potential risk of bias from AI ranking last in 
every country. 
The experience or observation of negative 
outcomes is also similar across economies 
(Emerging: 46% vs. Advanced: 40%). However, 
as shown in Figure 22, there is a trend for people 
in emerging economies to be more likely to have 
experienced or observed job loss due to AI 
(46% vs. 34% in advanced economies). 
People in emerging economies are 
more likely to believe the benefits of AI 
outweigh the risks: opinion is divided in 
advanced countries
Globally, 42 percent of people believe the 
benefits of AI outweigh the risks, compared to 
32 percent who believe the risks outweigh the 
benefits, and 26 percent who believe benefits 
and risks are balanced. This aligns with the 
finding that more people report experiencing 
benefits from AI than negative outcomes.
However, there are significant country 
differences in how people perceive the balance 
between AI risks and benefits. Half of people in 
emerging economies believe benefits outweigh 
risks, but opinions are more divided in advanced 
economies, where 38 percent believe the 
benefits outweigh risks and an almost equal 
number (37%) believe the risks outweigh the 
benefits. This aligns with the previously reported 
finding that more people in emerging economies 
expect and experience benefits from AI.
As shown in Figure 23, over 60 percent believe 
benefits outweigh risks in Nigeria, China, and 
Egypt (from 61% in Egypt to 74% in Nigeria). 
In contrast, a third or less agree that the 
benefits outweigh the risks in Australia, 
New Zealand, the Netherlands, Sweden, 
Finland, Canada, Ireland, and France. 
Although perspectives on AI vary across 
economies, in no country does the belief that 
AI risks outweigh the benefits reach 50 percent. 
This suggests that, despite concerns, most 
people in all countries acknowledge the benefits 
of AI systems.

In summary
Taken together, the extensive range of benefits and negative outcomes 
experienced from AI use highlights the paradoxical impacts of AI 
systems on individuals and society. For example, depending on how it 
is implemented and for what purpose, AI systems can either increase 
fairness or augment bias, facilitate accurate information or contribute 
to misinformation, enhance what people can do or deskill people. 
As with all powerful technologies that augment capabilities and offer 
transformative opportunities for advancement and growth while also 
augmenting risks and negative outcomes, AI systems require careful 
management and governance, together with guardrails and guidance 
to ensure appropriate and responsible use and prevent harm. 
It is with this in mind that we turn next to examine the public’s 
expectations of the regulation and governance of AI.
Concern about the risks of AI has 
increased with fewer believing that 
the benefits outweigh the risks
The view that the benefits of AI outweigh 
the risks has decreased from 2022 to 
2024 from 50 percent to 41 percent 
(M=4.4 vs. M=4.1). This reflects a 
decline in 15 of the 17 countries, with 
the largest reductions in Brazil and India. 
For example, in Brazil the belief that the 
benefits of AI outweigh the risks fell from 
71 percent in 2022 to 44 percent in 2024 
(M=5.0 vs. M=4.5) and in India it fell from 
72 percent to 55 percent (M=5.2 vs. 4.6).
In line with this change and the increase 
in worry about AI previously report, 
concern about the risks of AI systems 
increased in nine countries. The largest 
increases were in the Netherlands 
(up from 67% feeling concerned about 
AI risks in 2022 to 85% in 2024, M=3.1 
vs. 3.5) and Germany (65% vs. 79%, 
M=3.0 vs. 3.4). There was no reduction 
in the perceived risks from AI systems 
over time in any country. 
In contrast, there was no change in 
the perceived benefits from AI in most 
countries, with small increases or 
decreases in five countries.

What do people expect from the 
regulation and governance of AI?
Given the risks and benefits associated with AI, we asked people about 
their expectations of the regulation and governance of AI including whether 
regulation is necessary, whether current regulation and institutional 
safeguards are sufficient, and who should regulate AI. We also explored 
who is trusted to develop and use AI, and the role of governance and 
assurance mechanisms in supporting trust in AI.
Before presenting findings on public perceptions 
of AI regulation, it is important to recognize that 
regulatory approaches vary significantly across 
jurisdictions. For example, the European Union 
has adopted the comprehensive EU AI Act, 
while other jurisdictions are at different stages 
of maturity—ranging from developing AI-specific 
frameworks to relying primarily on guidelines 
or existing regulation. This diversity highlights 
the absence of a unified global approach and 
provides important context for interpreting 
public perceptions of AI regulation.
The majority in almost all countries 
surveyed believe AI regulation 
is required 
Given the perceived and experienced risks 
and impacts of AI, it is not surprising that 
70 percent of people across countries globally 
believe AI regulation is required. Only 17 percent 
believe that AI regulation is not needed, with 
the remaining 13 percent unsure. This finding 
corroborates our prior survey findings, and 
other independent surveys indicating strong 
public desire for the regulation of AI.28 
As shown in Figure 24, the majority of people in 
all countries view AI regulation as a necessity. 
India is the exception, where just under half (48%) 
agree regulation is needed. In all other countries, 
the percentage reporting that AI regulation is 
needed ranges between 57 percent in the UAE 
to 86 percent in Finland. 
This broad public consensus of the need to 
regulate AI supports the many national and 
international efforts to regulate and govern AI to 
minimize negative societal outcomes and harm.

The current regulatory landscape is not 
meeting public expectations: Only two 
in five people believe current regulation 
and laws governing AI are sufficient
The majority (57%) of people disagree or 
are unsure that current regulation, laws and 
safeguards are sufficient to make AI use safe 
and protect people from harm (see Figure 25). 
Only two in five (43%) believe that regulation 
and laws governing AI systems are sufficient. 
This finding aligns with prior surveys29 indicating 
people want more effective regulation of AI.
This pattern is strongest in the advanced 
economies, where only 37 percent view current 
regulation and laws as adequate. As evidenced 
in Figure 25, a third or less view regulation 
as adequate in the advanced economies of 
New Zealand, Finland, Japan, Sweden, Canada, 
the USA, Australia, Ireland, France, the UK, 
and Germany. 
In contrast, 55 percent of people in emerging 
economies view the safeguards around AI as 
sufficient. This predominantly reflects the six 
countries where a significant majority believe 
current safeguards are sufficient, namely India, 
Nigeria, China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, 
and Egypt.
To further understand the adequacy of current 
regulation and laws, respondents were asked if 
there is too much regulation of AI. 
In the advanced economies, the dominant 
response is to disagree (45%), followed by those 
who are neutral or don’t know (35%). Only one 
in five (20%) agree that there is already too 
much regulation of AI. People in the emerging 
economies, are more evenly split, with about a 
third (32%) disagreeing that there is too much 
regulation, another third (30%) neutral or reporting 
that they don’t know, and 38 percent agreeing. 
The country-level data shows that the only 
countries where the majority believe there is too 
much AI regulation are India, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, 
and the UAE. 
The strong association between perceived 
adequacy of AI regulation with trust (r=.67), 
acceptance (r=.64), and use of AI (r=.45), and 
confidence in organizations to develop and use 
AI in the public interest (r=.51) highlights the 
importance of developing an effective regulatory 
framework to underpin AI adoption.

Most people are not aware of laws, 
regulation or policy that apply to AI
These views about the adequacy of regulation 
and laws may reflect, in part, low awareness of 
the regulatory landscape, given four in five people 
(83%) are not aware of any laws, regulation or 
government policy that apply to AI within their 
respective country. 
There is significant variation across countries, 
ranging from 5 percent awareness of AI regulation 
in the Czech Republic to 49 percent in China. 
Awareness is highest in the emerging economies 
of Nigeria, Costa Rica, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the 
UAE, India and China (ranging from 27 percent 
to 49 percent aware). Amongst the advanced 
economies, awareness is notably highest 
in Norway (32%), followed by Estonia, Latvia, 
Singapore and Switzerland (24% respectively), and 
under 17 percent in other advanced economies.30 
There is a strong public mandate for 
international and national regulation of AI 
As shown in Figure 26, a clear majority of people 
(between 64% and 76%) support multiple forms 
of regulation. Three in four expect international 
laws and regulation and seven in ten expect co-
regulation by industry, government, and existing 
regulators, and independent oversight from their 
country’s government and existing regulators. 
Just under two thirds expect governance from 
industries that use or develop AI systems and a 
dedicated, independent AI regulator.
As shown in Figure 27, international laws and 
regulation was the most endorsed form of 
regulation in most countries. A clear majority 
of people in all countries support having 
international laws and regulation, with agreement 
ranging from 60% to 86%. This may reflect an 
appreciation that many AI platforms operate 
across borders and are often developed and used 
by multinational organizations headquartered 
outside of one’s own country, requiring laws and 
regulation at the international level to ensure 
oversight and application across jurisdictions. 
In addition to international laws and regulation, 
people in most countries express a preference for 
national government regulation or a co-regulatory 
approach between government and industry, over 
self-regulation by industry or an independent AI 
regulator. However, it is notable that a majority in 
almost all countries endorse each of these forms 
of regulation, in line with the broad reach, uptake 
and impact of AI across multiple sectors and 
levels of society.
These findings indicate the public has a strong, 
shared expectation of a multipronged regulatory 
approach at international and national levels to 
govern AI, with active involvement from both 
government and industry.

People who have AI training or education, or 
higher levels of AI literacy (AI knowledge or 
AI efficacy), report greater awareness of laws 
and regulations that apply to AI (r=.34-.42). 
This suggests that one pathway to lift regulatory 
awareness is through AI literacy programs.

A clear public mandate for stronger 
regulation of AI-generated misinformation
We further examined impacts and expectations 
related to AI-generated misinformation and 
disinformation. As shown earlier in the report 
(see Figure 20), this is a key concern for the 
majority of people.
Our findings suggest that AI-generated 
misinformation is eroding trust in online content, 
with ripple effects for trust in elections. As shown 
in Figure 28, 70 percent of people are unsure 
if online content can be trusted because they 
don’t know if content is real or AI-generated, 
and 64 percent are concerned that elections are 
being manipulated by AI-powered bots and AI-
generated content. This is further exacerbated 
by the fact that over half of people do not feel 
they can identify AI-generated misinformation.
Given these concerns, almost nine in ten 
respondents say they want stronger laws and 
actions to combat AI-generated misinformation. 
A large majority agree that there should be 
laws to prevent the spread of AI-generated 
misinformation. They want news and social media 
companies to implement stronger fact-checking 
processes to combat AI-generated misinformation, 
and methods (such as watermarking) to allow 
people to detect when content is AI generated.

Organizational assurance mechanisms 
enhance trust in AI systems
In addition to external rules, laws, and 
safeguards, we asked about a range of assurance 
mechanisms available to organizations to support 
and signal their trustworthy and responsible 
use of AI. These mechanisms range from 
monitoring system reliability to human oversight 
and accountability, responsible AI policies and 
training, adhering to international AI standards, 
and independent third-party AI assurance 
systems (see Figure 29).
Four out of five (83%) report they would be 
more willing to trust an AI system when such 
assurance mechanisms are in place. 
Each of these assurance mechanisms is viewed 
as important for trust across all countries (ranging 
from 69% in Japan to 89% in Türkiye and Nigeria). 
This indicates that these mechanisms can play a 
key role in strengthening trust in organizational AI 
use across diverse markets.

People have most confidence in 
universities and healthcare organizations 
to develop and use AI 
As shown in Figure 30, people have the most 
confidence in their country’s universities, research 
institutions, and healthcare organizations to 
develop and use AI in the best interests of the 
public. Between 78 percent and 88 percent report 
moderate to high confidence in these entities in 
advanced and emerging economies, respectively.
People are less confident in their government’s 
use of AI. Between 58 percent and 65 percent 
report moderate to high confidence in their 
national government to develop and use AI in 
the best interests of the public in advanced and 
emerging economies, respectively. However, two 
in five (40%) report low confidence. Addressing 
this low confidence in governmental use of AI 
will be important going forward to realize the 
many beneficial applications of AI use in public 
sector service delivery, including enabling 
equitable access to government services and 
enhancing the personalization, effectiveness 
and efficiency of service delivery. 
There is significant variation across countries in 
people’s confidence in government. Half or more 
(50 to 67%) lack confidence in their government 
to develop and use AI in the public's best interest 
in Argentina, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Japan, the USA, 
Colombia, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, Greece, 
the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In contrast, 
as shown in Figure 31, most people in Norway, 
Singapore, India, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and 
China have confidence in their government 
(ranging between 65% and 90%).
People in emerging economies report greater 
confidence in big technology companies, 
like Apple, Facebook/Meta, Google/Alphabet, 
Huawei, OpenAI and Tencent (84% vs 64% 
confident) and commercial organizations, such 
as retailers and banks (75% vs 60%), than those 
in advanced economies. For example, as shown 
in Figure 31, over 90 percent of people in China, 
Nigeria, India, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have 
moderate to high confidence in big technology 
firms. In comparison, countries with advanced 
economies tend to have lower confidence in 
big technology firms, such as France, the UK, 
Sweden, the USA, Denmark, Canada, Australia 
and New Zealand (ranging from 60% in France 
to 46% in New Zealand).
This highlights the potential opportunity for 
commercial organizations, big technology firms, 
and government to collaborate with universities 
and research institutions in the development of AI.
There has been no change in the perceived 
adequacy of AI safeguards over time, however 
the importance of organizational assurance 
mechanisms for trust has increased
The belief that AI regulation is needed has 
remained constant over time (71% in 2022 
vs 71% in 2024; M=2.5 vs. 2.6), as has the 
perceived adequacy of current regulations and 
laws (M=4.0 at both time points). However, 
there is a trend towards fewer people viewing 
current AI regulations as adequate in nine 
countries, largest reduction evident in Germany 
(41% agree in 2022 vs. 31% in 2024).
Given the increase in perceived risks of AI 
previously reported, it is not surprising that 
the importance of organizational assurance 
mechanisms has increased over time. Eighty 
percent of people in 2024 reported they 
would be more likely to trust AI systems when 
organizational assurance mechanisms are in 
place, compared to 72 percent in 2022 (M=5.6 
vs. M=5.0). There were significant increases 
in all 17 countries, with the largest in Canada, 
the UK and Finland (ranging from 69-74% in 
2022 to 81-84% in 2024).
When people are confident in entities to develop 
and use AI, they are more likely to trust (r=.54) 
and accept AI systems (r=.52), accept AI 
systems (r=.52), and use AI (r=.40).

In summary
Taken together, these findings reveal a clear public desire for stronger 
regulation and governance of AI systems that is fit-for-purpose in 
supporting safe and trustworthy use. The majority expect robust 
international and national regulation, but many do not believe that the 
current safeguards around AI are sufficient. There is also widespread 
support for stronger legislation and action that specifically targets AI-
generated misinformation.
The low level of public awareness of laws governing AI likely reflects 
that many jurisdictions are still in an early phase of designing and 
implementing regulatory frameworks. However, it also suggests 
a need to support people to understand if and how existing and 
emerging laws and regulation apply to AI. 
At the organizational level, the findings highlight that organizations 
can strengthen trust in their use of AI systems by putting in place 
governance and assurance mechanisms that signal trustworthy 
and responsible use. In the next section we further examine key 
pathways for supporting trust and acceptance of AI systems.

What are the key drivers of trust and 
acceptance of AI systems?
In the preceding sections, we identified that AI literacy and training, 
perceptions of the benefits and risks of AI, and the perceived adequacy of 
AI regulation and confidence in entities to use AI, are each associated with 
people’s trust and acceptance of AI systems used in society. To identify the 
most important predictors, we used a statistical technique called structural 
equation modeling.31 
The model examines four distinct pathways—reflecting knowledge, 
motivational, uncertainty, and institutional drivers—testing and comparing 
their importance in predicting trust and acceptance of AI. We show the 
model in Figure 32, together with notes on interpretation.
Trust is central to AI acceptance 
The model shows that trust is a key driver of AI 
acceptance (B=.4332), empirically supporting why 
trust in AI matters: if people are willing to trust AI 
systems, then they are more likely to accept and 
approve their use in society.
As explained below, the model further shows that 
trust acts as a central mechanism through which 
other drivers impact AI acceptance. 
AI literacy influences trust and acceptance
The knowledge pathway is based on evidence 
that knowledge, efficacy, and training—which 
each relate to AI literacy—help to enhance trust 
in technology.33 
The model shows that people are more likely 
to trust AI systems when they believe they 
understand AI and when and how it is used 
in common applications and have received AI 
education or training (B=.11). The knowledge 
pathway also has a direct impact on acceptance 
(B=.12). 
These relationships indicate the importance of 
providing people with opportunities to enhance 
their AI literacy.
The perceived benefits of AI foster 
increased trust and acceptance 
The motivational pathway to trust is grounded 
in evidence that the more people perceive 
benefits, utility, and positive outcomes from 
the use of technologies, the more they will 
be motivated to trust and accept them.34 
Expecting AI systems to produce benefits 
(B=.23) has a relatively strong influence on 
trust, as well as on levels of acceptance (B=.22). 
This relationship highlights the importance of 
designing and using AI systems in a way that 
delivers benefits to a broad range of people.

Uncertainty: risks
Knowledge: AI literacy
Institutional: safeguards 
& confidence
Motivational: benefits
AI Acceptance
Institutional drivers include:
•	 Safeguards: the belief that current laws, 
rules and governance are sufficient to 
ensure AI use is safe 
•	 Confidence in entities to develop and use 
AI in the best interests of the public
The extent to 
which people trust 
AI systems and 
perceive them to 
be trustworthy
The extent to which 
people accept and 
approve of AI systems
Knowledge drivers include indicators of 
AI literacy:
•	 AI knowledge: the extent to which people 
feel they understand AI and when and where 
it is used, including objective knowledge of 
AI use in common technologies
•	 AI efficacy: people’s self-assessed ability to 
use AI tools responsibly and effectively
•	 AI training: having completed a university 
course related to AI or received some form 
of AI training
Some demographics 
have a small impact on 
acceptance:
People in emerging 
economies are more 
accepting
People with 
university education 
are more accepting
Predictors also have a 
direct effect on acceptance 
after accounting for their 
influence via trust:

•	 Motivational: .22
•	 Uncertainty: -.05
•	 Institutional: .17

Motivational drivers include the expected 
benefits of AI: the extent to which people 
expect a range of benefits to arise from the 
use of AI systems
Uncertainty drivers include perceived 
risks of AI: the extent to which people are 
concerned about a range of risks related to 
the use of AI systems
How to read the model
When reading the model, follow the arrows from left to right. The left boxes show the four drivers of trust and 
acceptance, with notes explaining each driver in the boxes below the model. The values on the arrows indicate the 
relative importance of each driver in influencing trust and acceptance: the larger the number, the stronger the effect. 
The positive values for institutional safeguards and confidence, benefits, and knowledge, indicate that when these 
drivers increase, so do trust and acceptance. The negative value for uncertainty indicates that when perceived risks 
increase, trust and acceptance decrease. 
The model is based on all data (across countries and AI applications). All relationships shown are significant (p<.001).

The perceived risks of AI create uncertainty 
and reduce trust and acceptance
The uncertainty pathway is based on the view 
that it is more difficult to trust technologies 
in contexts of risk or when the outcomes and 
impacts of the technologies are uncertain.35
The model shows that the more concerned 
people are about the risks and potential negative 
outcomes of AI use in society, the less likely they 
are to trust the systems (B=-.08) or accept them 
(B=-.05). The impact of risk concern is notably 
smaller than that of benefit expectation, which 
helps to explain why people are willing to trust 
and accept AI systems in society and use them 
personally to gain benefits, despite concerns 
they may have about the risks.
This finding demonstrates the importance of 
proactively working to mitigate the perceived 
risks associated with AI systems at multiple 
levels and to effectively communicate the 
mitigation strategies that are in place to help 
reduce uncertainty, reassure people and 
support their trust in AI.
Institutional factors are the strongest 
drivers of trust, and also impact 
acceptance 
The institutional pathway reflects evidence that 
institutional safeguards and control mechanisms 
(e.g. laws, rules, standards) and confidence in 
the institutions deploying technologies reassure 
people of the safety, reliability and trustworthiness 
of technologies.36 
Our findings indicate that people are more 
trusting of AI systems when they believe current 
regulation and laws are sufficient to make 
AI adoption and integration into society safe 
and are confident in a range of entities—from 
government, big tech companies, commercial 
organizations, research institutions, and health 
organizations—to develop and use AI in the 
public’s best interests (B=.62). The influence 
of institutional factors on acceptance is 
comparatively smaller (B=.17), suggesting 
that much of the influence of these factors 
on acceptance occurs via trust.
The model shows the institutional pathway is 
the most important pathway to trust. However, 
the broader survey results indicate that (a) 
many are not convinced that current laws and 
regulation are sufficient, and (b) perceptions of 
the adequacy of AI regulation have not shifted 
markedly over time. This stable perception 
of existing regulation highlights an ongoing 
challenge for policymakers when it comes to 
reassuring the public that there are appropriate 
laws, regulation and safeguards in place.
The model’s predictors explain 79 percent of the 
variance in trust and 72 percent of the variance 
in acceptance. The similarity of these findings to 
the model that was tested and validated in our 
prior research report37 reinforces the importance 
of these drivers and the robustness of the model 
when tested in a larger, more diverse sample.
In summary
In summary, the modeling indicates that each of the four pathways 
play a significant and complementary role in supporting trust and 
acceptance of AI use in society.

Younger people, higher income earners, 
the university-educated, and those with AI 
training are more trusting and accepting of 
AI systems, have higher levels of AI literacy, 
and are more likely to use AI
Analyses reveal that four subgroups are more 
trusting and accepting of AI, more likely to have 
higher levels of AI knowledge and efficacy, and 
more likely to use AI. As shown in Figures 33-
35, this applies to: 
•	 People with AI-related training or education 
(vs. those without)
•	 People with high household incomes (vs. 
middle- and low-income categories)
•	 Younger people, notably those aged 18-34 
years, compared to the oldest category of 
respondents (55+) 
•	 People with a university education (vs. no 
university education)
As shown in Figure 33, those with AI-related 
education or training are almost twice as likely 
to trust and accept AI technologies compared to 
those without. Similarly, high-income earners are 
twice as likely to trust AI and three times more 
likely to have high acceptance of AI compared to 
those with lower incomes. 
How do demographic factors influence 
trust, attitudes and use of AI? 
To understand how attitudes and experiences with AI systems vary 
across demographic groups, we examined the influence of age, income, 
education, AI training, and gender on trust, acceptance, and the key drivers 
in our model. 
The analyses reveal that AI training and income consistently have the 
strongest effects. It is notable that there are no differences between men 
and women on any of the key indicators.
Over
80%
of people under 35, people 
with AI training, and those 
with high incomes use AI 
tools, compared to less than
50%
of those 55 years of age and 
older, those who do not have 
AI training, and people with 
low incomes.

In relation to the use of AI tools, over 80 percent 
of people under 35, people with AI training, and 
those with high incomes use AI tools on a regular 
basis, compared to less than 50 percent of those 
55 years of age and older, those who do not have 
AI training, and people with low incomes (see 
Figure 34).
These findings likely reflect that younger people, 
those with higher incomes, and the university-
educated are more likely to have completed AI 
training or AI-related education and have higher 
levels of AI knowledge and efficacy (see Figure 
35). For instance, 71 percent of young adults 
report moderate to high levels of AI knowledge, 
compared to 33 percent of older adults. 
80 percent of high-income earners feel confident 
about using AI, compared to 44 percent of low-
income respondents. Strikingly, 70 percent 
of those with high income report having AI 
education or training, compared to 38 percent 
of middle-income earners and just 18 percent of 
those who report low income. Over 9 in 10 (92%) 
of high-income earners are interested in learning 
more about AI, compared to just 42 percent of 
low-income earners. 
People with AI training and high-income 
earners report more benefits from AI 
Individuals with AI training and high-income 
earners are more likely to expect a range of 
benefits from AI compared to low-income earners 
and those with no AI training or education (High 
income: 90%, vs. middle: 83%, vs. low: 74%; 
AI education or training: 89%, no AI education 
or training: 79%) and report experiencing more 
positive outcomes (High income: 80%, middle 
income: 72%, low income: 60%; AI training or 
education: 79%, no AI education or training: 
63%). Higher AI literacy and use, together with 
greater access to resources, may uniquely 
position these groups to seize the benefits of AI 
use, and protect them from negative outcomes.
Regarding the experience of specific benefits, 
80 percent of people who report high income 
have experienced enhanced decision-making, 
compared to 70 percent of middle-income 
earners and just 59 percent of those with low 
income. Those with AI education or training 
are particularly more likely to have experienced 
reduced costs or better use of resources (75% 
vs. 53%), enhanced creativity (76% vs. 54%), 
and enhancing what people can do (80% vs. 
65%). Concerns about negative AI outcomes and 
experiences of such outcomes are consistent 
across all subgroups.
Those with AI training, high-income 
earners and younger people are more likely 
to view AI regulation and laws as sufficient 
People with AI training, high-income earners 
and younger people are less likely to believe 
AI regulation is necessary. Only 54 percent 
of high-income respondents agree that AI 
regulation is required, compared to between 
72 percent and 75 percent of middle- and low-
income respondents. Similarly, 61 percent of the 
youngest age group believe that AI regulation is 
required, compared to 70 percent in the middle-
age range (35-44 years) and 79 percent in older 
age categories (55+ years).
These groups are also more likely to view existing 
AI regulation as sufficient, with 69 percent of 
high-income earners agreeing, compared to just 
28 percent of low-income earners.
Over
9 in 10
high-income earners are interested 
in learning more about AI, compared 
to just 42 percent of low-income 
earners.

In summary
Taken together, the pattern of findings suggests that people who are 
younger and university educated, and particularly those with AI training 
and higher incomes, are better positioned to use and realize the benefits 
from AI. This is likely due to their higher levels of AI literacy and resources.
In the next two sections, we examine how employees and students 
use, experience and trust AI in their work and education, and their 
perceptions of how their organizations govern and support AI adoption 
and responsible use. These sections are based on the subset of survey 
respondents who identified as working or studying, respectively.

Employee attitudes 
towards AI at work
SECTION TWO
To complement insights in prior sections, respondents who were 
working full or part-time38 were asked about their use of AI for 
work purposes and by their organization, including how they use 
AI, the impact of AI use on work and jobs, their trust in AI for work 
purposes, and organizational support for responsible AI.
Specifically, employees were asked to report how often they 
intentionally use AI tools and systems in their work, clarifying 
that this use is different from the passive use of AI (such as 
when AI operates behind the scenes in tools such as email 
filters and search engines).

How is AI being used by employees at work?
The age of working with AI is here: 
3 in 5 employees report intentional 
regular use of AI at work
The rapid adoption of AI in the workplace, 
augmented by the release of generative AI 
tools such as ChatGPT, is evident. 
As shown in Figure 36, 77 percent of 
employees report that AI is being used by 
their organization. Almost half (47%) report 
their organization uses AI to a moderate to 
very large extent across a range of areas 
and tasks, and thirty percent report limited 
use in isolated areas or specific tasks. Just 
under one-quarter of employees report their 
organization does not use AI.
Fifty-eight percent of employees report 
intentionally using AI tools and systems in 
their work on a regular basis. Less than half 
of employees report any form of training or 
education in AI or related fields (47%) or have 
at least a moderate level of AI knowledge 
(46%), and only half (51%) believe they 
can use AI effectively. 
Figure 37 shows that frequency of use 
varies; about a third (31%) use AI on a 
weekly or daily basis, about a quarter (27%) 
use it semi-regularly (i.e. every month or 
few months) and two in five (42%) rarely 
or never use it.

The one-quarter (27%) of employees who 
never intentionally use AI at work were asked 
to indicate the reasons why. The top reasons 
included39:
•	 AI tools are not helpful, required or used for 
their work (58%)
•	 A preference to work without the involvement 
of AI tools (19%)
•	 Not understanding how to use AI tools (14%)
•	 AI tools are not approved or allowed (14%)
•	 Not trusting AI tools (12%)
•	 Lack of access or not wanting to pay for AI 
tools (12%)
In several advanced economies—notably the 
USA, Australia, Switzerland, Sweden, New 
Zealand, and the Netherlands—a lack of trust in 
AI tools was one of the top three reasons for 
not using AI (reported by 15-20%). Compared 
to those in emerging economies, employees 
working in advanced economies are more likely 
to say that they did not use AI tools because 
they are not helpful or required for their work. 
These findings provide insight into the potential 
barriers of AI adoption at work, reinforcing the 
importance of supporting AI literacy amongst 
employees, providing access to AI tools, and 
facilitating understanding of how AI can be used 
for a range of work applications to create value. 
It also highlights the importance of respecting 
employees’ choice about the use of these tools 
in their work.

Adoption of AI at work has increased 
dramatically since the release of ChatGPT
In the 17 countries surveyed in 2022 
and 2024, the proportion of employees 
reporting intentional use of AI for work 
purposes increased from just over half 
(54%) in 2022 to two thirds (67%) in 
2024 (see Figure 38). These figures 
reflect any use of AI for work purposes, 
including rare and occasional use.
Employee use of AI increased in all 
countries, with the largest increases 
occurring in the USA, Canada, the UK, 
and Australia (ranging from 34-37% 
in 2022 to 58-66% in 2024).
Similarly, the number of employees 
reporting organizational use of AI 
increased from 34 percent in 2022 to 
71 percent in 2024, with significant 
increases in all 17 countries. The largest 
increases were again in the USA, 
Canada, the UK, and Australia, together 
with France and Korea (ranging from 
20-24% in 2022 to 62-70% in 2024).

Most employees use free, public 
generative AI tools at work, yet only 
a minority report their organization 
has a policy governing its use
Employees that report using AI were asked to 
identify the main AI tools they use for work (see 
Figure 39). By far the most common tools—
used by almost three in four employees—are 
general-purpose generative AI tools, such as 
ChatGPT. Voice-based AI assistants, such as 
Siri and Google Assistant, are the next most 
common, used by just under half of employees, 
followed by image, video and audio generators. 
These high-use levels likely reflect the broad 
accessibility of these tools, including the ability 
to use these tools through a natural language 
interface, combined with their wide utility across a 
range of work tasks and functions, and immediate 
usability without AI training or education.
Comparatively fewer employees use AI tools with 
a more specialized focus or specific purpose—
such as Grammarly or predictive analytics 
tools—or AI systems developed or customized 
specifically for their organization. Even fewer 
use robots and physical autonomous systems.
Employees were also asked how they access 
these tools (see Figure 40). The majority (70%) 
say they use publicly available AI tools that are 
free to use, with a much lower proportion using 
public AI tools that require payment to access. 
Two in five report using AI tools that are provided 
or managed by their employer.

Despite the extensive use of generative AI 
tools in the workplace, employees report that 
limited policies are in place to guide and outline 
appropriate use. 
As shown in Figure 41, only two in five report 
that their organization has a policy or provides 
guidance on the use of generative AI tools 
at work. It is notable that almost one in five 
do not know if their organization has a policy, 
highlighting a significant gap between use and 
knowledge of workplace policies on generative 
AI tools.
Emerging economies are leading in 
workplace adoption of AI
As shown in Figure 42, more employees in 
emerging economies report using AI at work 
compared to those in advanced economies 
(72% vs. 49% using AI at least semi-regularly). 
Similarly, those working in emerging economies 
are more likely to report that their organization 
uses AI (81% vs. 66% in advanced economies) 
and does so more extensively (57% vs. 36% 
have moderate to extensive use).40

To illustrate, as shown in Figure 43, 80 percent 
or more employees report using AI at work on 
a regular basis in the emerging economies of 
India, China, Nigeria, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and 
Egypt. This compares to less than 50 percent 
in the majority of the advanced economies. 
We find an almost identical pattern of findings 
across countries for the organizational use 
of AI.41
A few countries with advanced economies 
deviate from this trend. Norway, Singapore, and 
Switzerland have comparatively high workplace 
adoption of AI compared to other advanced 
economies, with more than 60 percent of 
employees using AI at least every few months 
or more, and over 75 percent reporting that 
their organization uses AI. This likely reflects the 
previously reported high levels of AI training, 
literacy, trust and acceptance of AI amongst 
people in these countries compared to those in 
other advanced economy countries (see Figures 7 
and 13).
One in two employees trusts AI at work 
Respondents were asked how willing they are 
to trust AI systems for work purposes either 
by relying on the information and output AI 
provides to inform their work and decisions or in 
sharing relevant information and data to enable AI 
tools to perform tasks for them. 
About half (53%) report trusting AI tools for work 
purposes, which is similar to the proportion of 
employees that use AI on a regular basis (58%). 
There are clear differences among countries, 
ranging between 31 percent in Japan to 81 percent 
in India and Nigeria (see Figure 43). 
Trust is highest in the emerging economies, with 
an average of 63 percent of employees in these 
countries trusting AI for work, compared to an 
average of 45 percent in advanced economies. 
Employees’ trust in AI for work purposes is 
associated with their frequency of AI use at 
work (r=.46) and experiencing positive impacts 
of AI use at work (r=.53), highlighting the 
important role of trust in adoption. Trust in 
AI for work purposes is also associated with 
AI knowledge, efficacy, and AI training or 
education (r=.23-.45).

Trust of AI at work and perceived 
organizational support for responsible 
AI use has declined in many countries
Employees' increased adoption of AI 
has coincided with a trend of declining 
trust in its use for work purposes 
(2022: M=4.5 vs. 2024: M=4.3), with 
a meaningful decline in 10 of the 
17 countries. Brazil saw the largest 
decrease (77% vs. 56% trust, M=5.2 
vs. 4.7), together with Japan (43% 
vs. 27% trust, M=4.2 vs. 3.6).
Given the low adoption of AI at 
work in 2022, this likely reflects 
employees’ increased understanding 
of the capabilities and limitations 
of AI tools for work purposes. For 
example, as employees experience 
‘hallucinations’ and errors when using 
generative AI tools, this is likely to 
have prompted a healthy recalibration 
of expectations and trust of these 
tools. Indeed, as previously reported, 
inaccurate outcomes are a commonly 
experienced negative outcome when 
using AI systems.
At the same time, employees’ 
perceptions of organizational support 
and governance of responsible AI 
use also decreased in nine of the 
17 countries surveyed. The largest 
decrease occurred in Finland, falling 
from 52% in 2022 to 41% in 2024 
(M=4.6 vs. 3.8), together with 
Germany (M=4.4 vs. 3.8) and the 
Netherlands (M=4.2 vs. 3.7). 
Taken together, these trends suggest 
that the rapid adoption of AI at work 
has prompted a recalibration of 
employees’ trust in AI tools and an 
increased awareness of the need for 
organizational support and governance 
of responsible AI use.

Many employees are using AI in 
complacent and inappropriate ways, 
augmenting risks for both organizations 
and individuals 
A notable finding is the extent to which 
employees report using AI at work in complacent 
and inappropriate ways (see Figure 44).
Almost one in two employees who use AI admit 
to doing so in ways that contravene organizational 
policies and guidelines. For example, about half 
(48-49%) of employees report that they have 
uploaded sensitive company information, such 
as financial, sales, or customer information, or 
copyrighted material, into public AI tools. Such 
behaviors are most common of employees who 
report their organization has banned generative 
AI (67%) or has a policy guiding generative AI use 
(56%), compared to those in organizations without 
such policies (33%) or those who are unsure if 
there is a policy (38%). This suggests outright bans 
may be ineffective, and that simply having policies 
does not guarantee compliance; clear guidance 
and education on responsible AI use is needed.
Employees also report using AI in ethically 
ambiguous ways. Almost half (47%) say they 
have used AI in ways that could be considered 
inappropriate and even more indicate that they 
have seen or heard other employees using 
AI tools in inappropriate ways (63%). Fifty-six 
percent say they have used AI tools at work 
without knowing if it is allowed.
Over half (57%) of employees also admit that 
they have used AI in non-transparent ways, 
including presenting AI-generated content as 
their own or avoiding revealing when they have 
used AI tools to complete their work. This non-
transparent use makes it even more challenging 
for leaders and managers to govern and manage 
employees’ use of AI at work.
The complacent use of AI may also reduce the 
quality and accuracy of work. Over half (56%) 
report they have made mistakes in their work 
from AI use. This likely reflects using incorrect 
or ‘hallucinated’ AI-generated content from 
generative AI tools and may also include 
misinterpretation of AI recommendations or 
output. Two-thirds of employees report having 
relied on AI output at work without critically 
evaluating the information it provides (66%) and 
putting less effort into their work due to AI (72%). 
A contributing factor to this complacent use 
may be a sense of pressure to use AI tools, 
with almost half (48%) of employees feeling 
concerned about being left behind if they do 
not use AI at work. In support of this view, 
there is a positive association between the 
extent employees feel strain at work and their 
complacent use of AI (r=.31). 
While the survey was anonymous to encourage 
honest responses from the participants, these 
findings may underreport the actual extent of 
complacent and inappropriate use of AI in the 
workplace, given social desirability bias.42 
48%
of employees report 
that they have uploaded 
company information, 
such as financial, sales, 
or customer information, 
into public AI tools.

This inappropriate and complacent use of AI may 
in part reflect a lack of critical engagement in the 
way employees are using AI. As shown in Figure 
45, on average, only half of employees say they 
regularly engage critically with AI at work. Rather, 
most employees do not routinely evaluate the 
output of AI or consider the limitations of AI tools 
when making decisions based on its output, or 
the ethical implications of using AI content. Most 
employees infrequently reflect on whether they 
are using AI tools appropriately or weigh up the 
benefits and risks of using them.

Employees experience performance 
benefits from AI, but also mixed 
impacts on workload, stress, 
collaboration, compliance, and 
surveillance
Employees in organizations that use AI were 
asked how AI has impacted a range of work 
processes and outcomes. They report a 
range of beneficial impacts on performance, 
contrasted with other complex, mixed 
impacts which potentially augment risks 
for organizations and employees. 
Focusing on the beneficial impacts, as shown 
in Figure 46 (see blue bars), a majority of 
employees (54-67%) report that the use of AI 
tools in their workplace is delivering a range of 
benefits including increased levels of efficiency, 
improved access to accurate information, 
enhanced innovation and idea generation, 
higher work quality and decision-making, better 
use and development of skills and abilities, 
and improved knowledge sharing. Almost half 
(46%) report the use of AI tools has increased 
revenue generating activity in their organization. 
These findings highlight the significant 
performance benefits from AI. 
However, the positive benefits of using AI 
tools are not guaranteed. A quarter to a third 
of employees report that the use of AI tools at 
work has not had an impact on these desired 
outcomes. For example, a similar proportion 
of employees report AI has had no impact 
on revenue generation as those reporting an 
increase. Furthermore, about one in ten report 
that the use of AI has actually reduced some of 
these desired outcomes. Whether or not AI use 
delivers beneficial outcomes is likely dependent 
on a combination of factors, including the 
nature of the work, the purpose and types 
of AI tools used, how AI is implemented and 
integrated into work design and organizational 
strategy, and the level of employees’ AI literacy 
and capabilities.
Employees also report that the use of AI is 
having mixed impacts on workload, time spent 
on repetitive tasks, and stress and pressure at 
work (see Figure 46). While about two in five 
(36-40%) employees have experienced positive 
reductions, between one-quarter and two-
fifths (26-39%) report increases in workload, 
repetition, stress and pressure from using AI 
tools. This is not surprising given the evidence 
that technological advancements can result 
in the intensification of work, highlighting the 
need for appropriate work redesign and change 
management.43 
AI training (r=.24), knowledge (r=.42), efficacy 
(r=.41), and perceptions of organizational 
support for AI and responsible use (r=.56) 
are positively associated with experiencing 
beneficial impacts of AI use at work.

AI use is also having mixed impacts on workplace 
communication and collaboration. While about 
two in five report that AI tools have increased 
communication and collaboration, close to a fifth 
report that AI use has reduced it. 
A third (35%) of employees report that the use of 
AI tools has resulted in increased compliance and 
privacy risks, such as contravening rules, policies 
and local laws. Since most employees report 
using free, publicly available generative AI tools, 
this may result in instances of uploading private, 
confidential or copyrighted material into public 
AI systems. One fifth of employees say using 
AI tools helps reduce compliance and privacy 
risks, which may reflect the growing use of AI for 
monitoring and managing cybersecurity threats 
as well as ensuring employee compliance with 
organizational policies. 
It is also notable that two in five report increased 
monitoring and surveillance of employees using AI 
technologies. This increase may have implications 
for trust in the workplace: while in some work 
contexts, monitoring and surveillance is required 
and beneficial for ensuring safe and trustworthy 
conduct and adherence to laws and governance 
policies, these control mechanisms can contribute 
to decreased levels of trust at work if perceived as 
signaling management distrust of employees.44
Most employees report that AI use in their 
workplace has either had no impact on job security 
or has increased it, with just under one in five 
reporting it had reduced job security. 
This complex mix of impacts underscores the 
importance of understanding, managing and 
monitoring the implementation, use and impacts 
of AI at work, investing in appropriate work 
redesign, and building employee capabilities to 
support effective and balanced levels of human-
AI collaboration.

The adoption of AI has changed how and 
by whom work is done with employees 
rapidly becoming dependent on AI and 
human-AI collaboration
The data suggests that about half of employees 
rely heavily on AI tools and collaboration with AI 
to perform their work, with two in five employees 
indicating that they sometimes or often cannot 
complete work without the help of AI (see Figure 
47). This reliance is likely to increase over time 
given that half of employees say they regularly 
rely on AI to perform tasks rather than learning 
the skills to do so themselves. 
These findings underscore the risk of employee 
skill degradation over time and align with our 
finding that deskilling and dependency on AI 
are key societal concerns and notable negative 
outcomes of AI adoption. This reinforces the need 
for thoughtful work design to ensure AI empowers 
humans to retain critical skills as well as focus 
on higher-skilled, meaningful work.
Our findings also reveal that about half of 
employees surveyed regularly choose to use AI to 
complete work, rather than collaborating with peers 
or supervisors. This has implications for achieving a 
diversity of inputs, as well as the development and 
retention of collaborative capabilities and processes 
in the workplace. It also highlights concerns about 
diminishing human interactions and connections 
from increased reliance on AI tools (previously 
reported in Figure 20). 
Most prefer AI involvement in managerial 
decision-making with human oversight
Further evidence of employees’ support for 
human-AI collaboration comes from their views 
of the use of AI in managerial decision-making. 
Respondents were asked to choose the most 
acceptable weighting between human and AI 
involvement in decision-making related to work 
and resource allocation, hiring, promotions, and 
pay rises.45
As shown in Figure 48, most believe that AI 
should aid managerial decision-making, but 
want humans to retain most or equal control. 
Nearly half consider a 75 percent human and 
25 percent AI decision-making split to be the 
most acceptable balance. The next most popular 
preference is an even 50/50 split, supported by 
just under a third of respondents.
Only ten percent believe AI should dominate 
managerial decision-making, and even fewer 
support a fully AI-driven approach where there is 
no human involvement. This highlights the lack of 
support for fully automated managerial decision-
making or AI taking precedence over humans in 
important workplace decisions.

Organizational support for AI and 
its responsible use is lagging behind 
adoption, particularly in advanced 
economies
The extent of complacent and inappropriate use of 
AI within the workplace highlights the importance 
of organizational support and governance of 
responsible AI use. Employees in organizations 
that are actively using AI, were asked whether 
their organization: a) has an AI strategy and culture, 
b) supports AI literacy and responsible use by 
employees, and c) has responsible AI governance 
practices in place, such as regular monitoring of AI 
systems, accountability systems to oversee AI use, 
and data privacy and security measures.
We find substantial variation between advanced 
and emerging economies (see Figure 49). 
In advanced economies, just over half of 
employees report that their organization has 
mechanisms in place to support AI adoption and 
responsible use, including a strategy and culture 
conducive to responsible AI adoption, adequate 
employee training, and governance processes. 
Only 55 percent believe there are adequate 
safeguards within their organization to ensure 
responsible AI use. While these findings are 
based on employee perceptions and awareness 
of these organizational support mechanisms, 
they suggest that just under half of organizations 
in advanced economies may be using AI without 
adequate support and governance.
In contrast, in emerging economies, about 
70 percent say their organization has a clear 
AI strategy, offers responsible AI training, 
and 65 percent report AI governance policies. 
Furthermore, 71 percent feel assured that 
sufficient safeguards exist for responsible AI 
use. This higher level of organizational support 
for AI aligns with the greater reported employee 
use of AI and higher levels of AI education and 
training, AI knowledge, and efficacy reported in 
emerging economies.
These findings are based on employees who report 
working in organizations that are actively using AI. 
We anticipate considerably lower organizational 
support for responsible AI in organizations that are 
considering but have not yet actively taken steps 
to integrate AI into their operations. 
Only
55%
of employees in advanced 
economies feel there are 
adequate safeguards within 
their organization to ensure 
responsible AI use. 
This suggests 
that just under
half
of organizations in advanced 
economies may be using AI 
without adequate support 
and governance.

Country-level data further illustrate these 
differences (see Figure 50).
Over 70 percent of employees in India, 
Nigeria, Egypt, China, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, 
Türkiye, South Africa, and Brazil report strong 
organizational support for responsible AI. Among 
advanced economies, Singapore, Switzerland, 
the UK, Norway, Italy, and Denmark lead, with at 
least 60 percent of employees reporting robust 
organizational support. In contrast, employees 
in Portugal, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and 
Finland report some of the lowest levels of 
organizational support.

AI’s impact on work and jobs: Only one 
in three believe AI will create more jobs 
than it will eliminate 
Employees are conscious of the potential impact 
of AI on work and jobs (see Figure 51). Over half 
agree that the way they do their daily work will 
change because of AI. 
In terms of job impacts, less than a third believe 
AI will create more jobs than it will eliminate. 
Rather, almost half believe the opposite—that 
AI will eliminate more jobs than it will create. 
This aligns with our earlier-reported finding that 
the potential for job losses from AI technology 
implementation is a key societal concern and is 
experienced or observed by two in five people.46 
Employees are split in their views on whether 
AI can perform key aspects of their work and 
will replace jobs in their specific area of work. 
This likely reflects the diverse range of jobs, 
occupations and industries represented in the 
survey sample, and the extent to which AI 
systems and capabilities are useful in these jobs. 
Our earlier finding that one in five employees 
report reduced job security from the use of AI 
suggests that a minority are directly experiencing 
AI-related job insecurity.
People in emerging economies are more optimistic 
about job creation from AI, with 39 percent 
agreeing AI will create more jobs than it will 
eliminate, compared to 23 percent of those in 
advanced economies. This is not blind optimism. 
Employees in emerging economies are also more 
likely than those in advanced economies to agree 
that key aspects of their work could be performed 
by AI (53% vs. 35%), how they do their work will 
change due to AI (64% vs. 48%), and more are 
concerned about being left behind if they don’t 
use AI (56% vs. 42%).
We next examine what encourages employee 
use of AI at work, and, importantly, what predicts 
critical engagement with AI tools.

What predicts the use and critical 
engagement of AI at work? 
The findings on employee use of AI highlights 
that organizations must navigate a complex 
balance between promoting AI adoption to realize 
the benefits, while simultaneously encouraging 
thoughtful, critical engagement with AI tools that 
underpins responsible use.
To help inform how this balance can be achieved, 
we conducted statistical modelling to identify the 
key predictors of AI use and critical engagement 
with AI at work, using the same techniques 
explained in the section ‘What are the key drivers 
of trust and acceptance of AI systems?’
These combined results highlight that AI literacy 
is a key lever, as the strongest predictor of both 
AI use and critical engagement. Experiencing 
positive performance benefits from AI also 
motivates both use and critical engagement. 
In contrast, experiencing negative impacts from 
AI reduces adoption but can prompt employees 
to adopt a more critical and discerning stance.
Our findings show that trust in AI systems 
encourages employee adoption, but its negative 
impact on critical engagement highlights the 
The predictors examined align with the four 
pathways discussed earlier: AI literacy (knowledge 
pathway), perceived performance benefits of AI at 
work (motivation), perceived negative impacts of 
AI use (uncertainty), and organizational support for 
AI, AI literacy, as well as responsible AI governance 
(institutional pathway). Additionally, the impact of 
trust in AI at work was examined. These models 
were tested using data from employees in 
organizations that use AI.
Our analysis revealed that each of the four 
pathways predicts both the frequency of AI use 
at work and critical engagement with AI, but in 
different ways.
need for organizations to avoid fostering blind, 
uncritical trust in AI tools. Instead, employees 
should be supported to calibrate their trust based 
on the technology’s trustworthiness and reliability. 
Cultivating an AI-friendly culture and strategy can 
help to encourage employees to use AI more 
frequently, whereas responsible AI governance 
mechanisms help to prompt deeper critical 
reflection when using AI tools. We explore the 
implications of these findings further in the 
Conclusions and Implications section.

Employees who are younger, AI trained, 
university-educated, higher-income 
earners and managers are more likely 
to use and trust AI at work and believe 
AI will change aspects of their work
As shown in Figure 52, younger people (aged 
under 35), those with AI training, university-
education, or higher incomes, and managers 
are more likely to use AI for work purposes and 
to trust AI in the workplace. These groups are 
also more likely to report that their organization 
uses AI, fosters an AI-driven culture, and 
supports responsible AI use. The largest 
differences are seen in relation to AI training 
and income.
This pattern mirrors our previously reported 
findings that these groups are more trusting 
and accepting of AI use in society and have 
higher levels of AI literacy, (see Figures 33-35).
These groups are also more likely to agree 
that AI will perform key aspects of their job 
and agree that AI will change the way they do 
their daily work (67% AI trained vs. 43% no 
AI training; 62% university educated vs. 44% 
no university education; 41% managers vs. 
21%-29% other occupations). Managers and 
high-income earners are also more likely to 
agree that AI will create more jobs than it will 
eliminate (65% managers vs. 36-56% other 
occupations; 54% high-income vs. 26% and 
17% of middle- and low-income respondents, 
respectively). 
Taken together, these findings suggest that 
these groups are better positioned to integrate AI 
into their work and realize performance benefits 
(see below). Conversely, employees without 
these attributes—namely older, lower-income 
employees, those without AI training or university 
education—may be at risk of being left behind 
and experience what has been called ‘AI divide’ in 
terms of progression, opportunities and benefits. 
High-income earners, those with AI 
training and managers report the most 
positive impacts from AI at work
As shown in Figure 53, higher-income earners, 
those with AI training, and people in managerial 
positions are more likely to report experiencing 
positive impacts from AI at work compared to 
middle- and low-income earners, employees 
without AI training and those in non-managerial 
occupations.
To illustrate specific positive impacts, high-
income earners are more likely to have 
experienced increased quality or accuracy of 
work (72%) compared to middle- (54%) and low-
income respondents (44%). Those with AI training 
and managers are more likely to report increased 
efficiency due to AI (76% vs. 56% without AI 
training; 75% of managers vs. 55-67% in other 
occupations) and increased revenue-generating 
activity from AI (55% vs. 34% without AI training; 
59% of managers compared to 40-43% in other 
occupations). 
How do demographic factors influence 
use and perceptions of AI at work?
There are notable differences between subgroups of employees in their 
use, trust, perceptions and realized benefits from AI use in the workplace, 
all of which have implications for the management of AI. We note at the 
outset that there are no gender differences in AI use or attitudes toward 
AI at work.

Younger employees, those with 
AI training, and those with higher 
incomes are more likely to engage in 
inappropriate and complacent use of 
AI at work 
It is notable that some of these groups are also 
the most likely to use AI inappropriately. After 
accounting for frequency of AI use at work in 
analyses,48 younger employees, those with AI 
training, and higher-income earners are more 
likely to use AI in their work in inappropriate or 
complacent ways. 
As shown in Figure 53, 65 percent of younger 
employees (aged under 35) report engaging in 
complacent and inappropriate use behaviors, 
compared to half or fewer of older employees 
([effect size] n²=.04).49 Similarly, employees with 
AI education or training report higher rates of 
complacent and inappropriate use (63% vs. 
46%; n²=.03), though they are also more likely 
to engage critically with AI in their work (53% vs. 
40% most of the time or always; n²=.03).
Income also plays a role, with higher-income 
earners (70%) being the most likely to report 
complacent or inappropriate AI use. Notably, they 
are also more likely to engage in AI behaviors that 
contravene AI policies than other income groups 
(n²=.03).
While frequency of use explains some of the 
variation in inappropriate and complacent use, 
it does not fully account for the observed 
differences in these groups. Other underlying 
factors such as understanding of AI, workplace 
norms, or training, may shape how AI systems 
are being used. For example, these groups may 
have developed ways of using and relying on AI 
in their work before guidelines were established, 
leading to the formation of unhealthy complacent 
norms. The higher trust levels in AI among these 
groups may also influence them to over-trust 
and rely on these technologies more than other 
groups. In addition, these groups may feel that 
their heightened understanding of AI or seniority 
gives them license to decide how best to use AI.
Employees working in the IT, finance 
and insurance, and media and 
communications sectors report the 
highest AI adoption and those in 
government and public administration 
report the lowest adoption 
We sampled employees in each of the 18 
sectors shown in Figure 54.50 Sampling was 
naturally occurring rather than representative of 
each industry and ranged from 527 employees 
in the real estate industry to 3,415 employees 
in the manufacturing sector and are based on 
employee perceptions and experiences. As such, 
the findings should be interpreted as indicative 
of broad trends. 
Our analysis revealed statistically significant 
differences between industries on a range of 
indicators, most notably:
•	 Employees in the Information Technology (IT), 
Media and Communications, and Financial and 
Insurance sectors report the highest use of AI 
at work (72-85%, see Figure 54) and greatest 
organizational adoption of AI (90-94%). 
•	 Employees in the IT and Financial and 
Insurance sectors also report the greatest 
organizational support for AI (75-76%), trust 
in the use of AI at work (62-67%), beneficial 
impacts from AI use (63-66%), and job impacts 
from AI (68-72%). 
•	 In contrast, employees in the Government and 
Public Administration, Healthcare and Social 
Assistance, and Transport and Logistics sectors 
report the lowest employee adoption of AI 
(43-47%), organizational adoption (61-63%), 
organizational support for AI and its responsible 
use (55-60%), and the least beneficial impacts 
from AI (48-52%). 
•	 Employees in the Arts, Entertainment and 
Recreation Services and Healthcare and Social 
Assistance sectors report the lowest trust in 
AI at work (46-48%) and are the least likely to 
believe that AI can perform key aspects of their 
work (33-35% agree).
•	 After accounting for frequency of use in 
analyses, there are no differences in complacent 
or inappropriate use between industries.

In summary
Taken together, these findings reveal a complex and nuanced picture of AI 
use in the workplace. A majority of employees are intentionally using AI 
at work, and experiencing positive impacts, particularly performance and 
efficiency benefits. However, there are mixed effects from AI integration, 
particularly on workload, stress, and collaboration. Many employees are 
using AI in ways that are inappropriate or complacent, with organizational 
support and governance for responsible AI use perceived to be lagging, 
particularly in advanced economies. These factors, combined with the 
insight that most employees use free, publicly available generative AI tools 
in organizations that lack clear policies on its use, opens up substantial 
organizational risk. While most employees trust AI at work and accept its 
involvement in managerial decision-making, rapid adoption is reshaping 
workflows and deepening dependency on human-AI collaboration.
In the final empirical section, we examine AI use by students who represent 
the workforce of the future.

Student attitudes 
towards AI in 
education
SECTION THREE
Respondents who were currently studying were asked about the 
intentional use of AI in their studies, the types of AI tools they 
use, if their education providers support responsible AI use, and 
the impact of AI use in education.
The majority of students were enrolled in university education 
(65%) or a vocational, trade or technical program (16%), with 
the remainder in secondary education (18%; see Appendix 2 
for sample details).

How is AI being used by students?
Four in five students regularly use AI in 
their studies
Most students (83%) use AI in their studies 
on a regular basis, with half using it weekly or 
daily. Eighty-three percent of students also use 
AI for personal, non-study-related purposes at 
least semi-regularly.
Students are more likely to use AI in their 
studies than employees are in their work (83% 
vs. 58% use AI regularly or semi-regularly; see 
Figure 55).
About half of students (53%) report trusting AI 
tools in their studies, which mirrors the finding 
for employees (52% trust).
While about half (53%) report receiving AI 
education or training, 72 percent indicate that 
they have at least moderate knowledge about 
AI and feel they can use AI tools effectively. 
Collectively, these results suggest most 
students feel confident in their knowledge 
and ability to use AI systems.
Of the few students who do not use AI in their 
studies (8%, n=195), the most common reasons 
are that they prefer to do their work without AI 
(55%), followed by the belief that AI tools are 
not helpful or required (34%), and that AI will 
have a negative impact on their learning (31%).
Freely available general-purpose 
generative AI tools are most used 
by students
Mirroring the pattern for employees, students 
are most likely to use general-purpose 
generative AI tools (89%) and voice-based 
AI assistants (42%) in their studies, (see 
Figure 56), and are much more likely to use 
free, publicly available tools (89%) than tools 
provided by their education provider (26%), or 
those that require payment to access (12%).

Many students use AI inappropriately 
or complacently
Only half of students (52%) who use AI in their 
studies critically engage with it on a regular basis, 
for example by evaluating AI output or verifying 
its accuracy before using it, and considering the 
limitations of an AI tool when making decisions 
based on its output. Rather, many students report 
using AI in complacent or inappropriate ways 
(see Figure 57). 
Almost three in five (59%) students report 
having used AI in ways that contravene their 
education provider’s policies or guidance. 
Over half (56%) say they have used AI tools 
in ways that could be considered inappropriate, 
and 84 percent state that they have seen 
or heard of other students using AI tools in 
inappropriate ways.
Most report using AI in ethically ambiguous and 
non-transparent ways, such as using AI tools 
without knowing whether it is allowed, avoiding 
revealing when they have used AI tools in their 
coursework, and presenting AI-generated content 
as their own.
The findings also suggest that students are 
becoming increasingly dependent and over-reliant 
on AI tools in their studies, with implications for 
learning. Over three quarters say they have relied 
on AI to complete tasks rather than learning how 
to do them themselves, or felt unable to complete 
their coursework without its help (see Figure 57). 
Eighty-one percent say they have put less effort 
into their studies or assessment knowing they can 
rely on AI, and two-thirds have made mistakes in 
their work due to AI.
One potential contributor to the inappropriate 
and complacent use of AI may be a sense of 
competitive pressure to use AI tools, with half of 
students indicating they are concerned about being 
left behind if they don’t use AI tools in their studies. 
Such competitive pressure could lead to increased 
use and greater dependence on AI, potentially 
cascading into complacent use.
Students are more likely to report inappropriate 
or complacent AI use and over-reliance on AI in 
their studies than employees are in their work. 
For example, around three quarters (76%) of 
student AI users say they have relied on AI output 
without evaluating the information or felt unable to 
complete their work without AI (77%), compared 
to two thirds (66%) of employees.

Students experience positive impacts 
of AI use in education, but AI’s influence 
on social dynamics, critical thinking, 
and fairness and equity is mixed
Figure 58 shows the impacts of AI use in 
education. The purple bars show a positive impact, 
for example by increasing efficiency and decreasing 
stress and pressure. The blue bars indicate a 
negative impact, for example by reducing critical 
thinking and increasing time on mundane tasks. 
As shown in this figure (see purple bars), the 
majority of students report notable positive impacts 
from the use of AI in their education, including 
increased efficiency, quality and accuracy of 
work, idea generation and innovation, and the 
personalization of learning. Over half also report 
reduced workload and stress and pressure.
However, there are also mixed impacts. A quarter 
to a third of students (27-36%) report the use 
of AI in education has reduced critical thinking, 
as well as communication, interaction, and 
collaboration with instructors and peers, trust 
of students by instructors and peers, and the 
fairness and equity of assessments, while similar 
proportions report AI has had a positive impact 
on these outcomes. There are also mixed impacts 
on skill development and time spent on mundane 
tasks, with almost half of students reporting 
positive impacts and a quarter to a third reporting 
negative impacts.
These findings suggest that while AI can offer 
substantial advantages—particularly for completing 
tasks—AI use may also inadvertently hinder key 
essential interpersonal and cognitive skills, and as 
well documented, raise challenges for the fairness 
and equity of assessment. 
Students’ perceptions of the impacts of AI 
on jobs and the world of work broadly mirror 
those reported for employees. Fewer than one 
in three believe AI will create more jobs than 
it will eliminate, with almost half disagreeing.
What are the impacts of AI use in education?

Support for responsible AI use in 
education is lagging adoption: only half of 
students report their education provider 
has a policy guiding generative AI use
Despite the pervasive use of AI by students, only 
half of the students surveyed (49%) believe their 
education provider has appropriate safeguards in 
place to make them feel comfortable with the use 
of AI in learning and teaching.
Only half report their education provider supports 
responsible AI use by having policies in place to 
ensure equitable use in learning and assessment 
and providing students access to training and 
resources on responsible use (see Figure 59). 
This low investment may reflect that only half 
of students report that their education provider 
encourages students to use AI in their learning 
and supports them to innovate with AI. 
Given the high use of generative AI by students, 
it is notable that less than a third report that 
their education provider has a policy in place to 
guide the responsible use of generative AI by 
students, and one in five indicate that there are 
policies banning generative AI use (see Figure 
60). A quarter of students do not know if there is 
a policy in place, suggesting a lack of awareness 
may be contributing to complacent use.
These student-reported insights suggest many 
education providers are not adequately supporting 
students in the responsible use of AI or are not 
making students sufficiently aware of relevant 
policy, training and resources.

In summary
These findings highlight that while most students are using and benefiting from 
AI, the complacent and inappropriate use of AI in education is widespread, and 
students are experiencing mixed impacts from AI use. Furthermore, education 
providers appear to be lagging in providing adequate training, resources and 
policy guidance to support and enforce the responsible use of AI by students. 
These findings have implications for the effective development of critical skills 
and the integrity of assessment in the AI age, and the future of work, as these 
students become the workforce of the future. 
We next discuss the implications of these findings and the broader 
research insights.

Conclusion and 
implications
Underlying this ambivalence is the tension between realizing the benefits of AI and ensuring its 
responsible use. This tension is evident at multiple levels: 
•	 At the societal level, governments seek to realize the national economic and productivity gains from 
AI and harness its potential to transform social services and address societal challenges, whilst also 
exercising their responsibility to protect societal values and safeguard citizens from harm and unfair 
treatment. Some jurisdictions view ongoing and significant investment in responsible AI as key to 
fostering competitive advantage.52
•	 Citizens want to benefit from the promise of AI, while feeling safe and avoiding manipulation, fraud, 
privacy and IP loss, bias, and the damaging societal consequences of prolific mis- and disinformation. 
•	 At the organizational level, leaders seek to realize enhanced productivity, innovation, value creation 
and competitive advantage from AI, whilst mitigating material and reputational risks and building 
sustained stakeholder trust.
•	 At the individual level, employees and students seek to enhance efficiency, quality and creativity 
in work and study, while avoiding deskilling, loss of jobs and the erosion of meaningful human 
connection. Some feel they have little choice but to adopt AI, fearing that not using it risks them 
becoming uncompetitive and left behind.
The research insights from this global survey highlight the current and future opportunities 
and challenges of responsibly stewarding AI into work, education, and society.
Our findings reveal rapid adoption of AI despite substantial public ambivalence toward its 
use. Although a clear majority recognize the technical competence, utility, and benefits 
of AI, fewer are assured of its safety and security, and many are concerned about the 
societal impacts. This ambivalence manifests in the cautious acceptance of AI coupled 
with limited trust, and optimism about its benefits coupled with worry about the risks.51 
This tension helps explain why the pace of AI 
adoption in the quest for performance gains has 
often outstripped AI literacy, training, governance, 
and regulation. It is also why there is a public 
mandate for stronger regulation and governance 
of AI, and growing desire for assurance of its 
trustworthy use. 
Effectively navigating this tension is one of the 
grand challenges of our time53 and will require 
proactive and sustained action and effort from 
multiple actors at all levels. 
To help address this challenge, we draw out the 
insights and implications of the research for key 
groups at the forefront of AI adoption, integration, 
governance and regulation. These include 
government policymakers, regulators and citizens; 
organizational leaders, managers and employees; 
and education providers and students.

Emerging economies are leading 
in public and employee AI adoption, 
trust, acceptance and realized benefits
A key insight is the notable difference in adoption 
and sentiment toward AI between countries with 
emerging and advanced economies. People in 
emerging economies report accelerated adoption 
and a pattern of greater trust, acceptance, and 
positive attitudes toward AI. They also self-
report higher levels of AI literacy and training, 
realized benefits both in work and society, 
and organizational support and governance for 
responsible AI use.54 This pattern is particularly 
strong in countries such as India, China, Nigeria, 
Egypt and the UAE.
This pattern may be due to the increasingly 
important role that transformative technologies 
play in the economic development of these 
countries55 and the greater relative benefits and 
opportunities AI affords people in emerging 
economies.56 For example, AI systems may 
help fill critical resource gaps in these countries 
by enabling access to quality information and 
services where access is limited. 
AI may provide augmented opportunities for 
people and organizations in emerging economies 
to overcome economic disadvantage and barriers. 
By bridging gaps in language, skills, information 
or networks, people in these countries may 
enhance their competitiveness and be able to 
seize a broader range of work and economic 
opportunities, including access to global markets. 
This potential may encourage a growth mindset that 
motivates trust, acceptance, and use of technology 
as a means to accelerate economic progress, 
prosperity, and quality of life. It may also motivate 
investment in AI training and literacy as a foundation 
for realizing and augmenting the benefits.
The greater levels of trust and acceptance seen 
in emerging economies can be explained, in part, 
by the pathways in our model. Higher levels of AI 
literacy (knowledge pathway), greater perceived 
and experienced benefits (motivational), and more 
favorable views of the adequacy of regulation 
and confidence in industry to develop and use AI 
responsibly (institutional) help to reduce concerns 
about risks (uncertainty pathway) and shape the 
view that benefits outweigh risks.
Similar pathways also help to explain why 
emerging economies are leading in AI workplace 
adoption and trust at work, with employees 
reporting more beneficial outcomes from 
organizational AI use, as well as higher levels 
of AI training and literacy and more perceived 
organizational support for responsible use, which 
helps mitigate risks and uncertainty.
These insights raise the question of whether 
governments and organizations operating in 
advanced economies need to augment investment 
and support in AI training and literacy, as well as 
strategic use and governance of AI to help realize 
benefits and support adoption.
Looking ahead, the nations that accelerate 
in responsible adoption may be uniquely 
positioned to gain long-term competitive and 
strategic advantage if AI becomes a central 
driver of productivity, innovation, and progress 
on societal challenges, such as climate change. 
This potential advantage, combined with the 
increasing importance of AI for national security, 
could prompt new dynamics in international 
relations, including debates around access to 
AI technologies and whether restrictions might 
emerge in response to perceived strategic or 
economic gains. 
While a challenge to AI adoption, we caution 
against viewing the lower trust and acceptance 
in advanced economies as a deficit. Rather it can 
be viewed as appropriate rational caution based 
on the perceived state of AI use in society, the 
current levels of governance, regulation and 
standards supporting it, coupled with low levels 
of AI literacy. Well-placed trust in AI systems is 
grounded in informed and accurate assessments 
of their benefits, limitations, and safeguards. 
Interventions to strengthen trust and acceptance 
can focus on enhancing the adequacy of regulation 
and investing in initiatives to mitigate negative 
outcomes from AI use, designing and deploying 
AI systems to maximize beneficial outcomes and 
reduce risks (e.g. privacy by design), strengthening 
organizational assurances and governance of 
trustworthy use, and systematically improving AI 
literacy, through public and employee AI education 
programs, for example.
Our findings further suggest the high trust 
and acceptance levels in emerging economies 
are not based on blind optimism: people in 
these economies perceive and experience 
negative outcomes of AI in a similar way to 
those in advanced economies. Rather, they 
experience augmented benefits, which offset 
these risks. However, it is important to guard 
against overconfidence and complacency that 
can stem from high trust by encouraging critical 
engagement, for example.

While there is a distinct pattern between advanced 
and emerging economies, it is important to 
recognize that countries within these broad 
categories vary substantially in their economic, 
cultural, political, and historical contexts, and there 
are country exceptions that don’t fall neatly into 
these patterns.
There is a public mandate for AI 
regulation with the current regulatory 
landscape falling short of expectations: 
implications for policymakers
The 47 countries surveyed represent a variety 
of approaches and stages in AI regulation and 
governance.
At the time of data collection, countries such as 
Singapore and China stood out for the breadth 
of regulatory and governance measures that 
had been implemented. Other jurisdictions, 
such as the European Union and Korea, had 
designed comprehensive AI laws and regulatory 
frameworks and were in the process of 
implementation. Countries such as Australia, 
India, and Canada were debating proposed AI-
specific legislative frameworks. Similarly, a range 
of countries—including emerging economies 
such as Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, and the UAE—had 
implemented or proposed AI guidelines without 
adopting comprehensive legislation. The UK 
and the USA (including individual US states) 
had launched multiple initiatives but lacked a 
unified regulatory approach. Notably, after data 
collection, the US Government scaled back its 
approach to AI regulation, and while 58 countries 
signed the Paris AI Action Summit agreement, 
the USA and UK did not.57
In the context of this lack of a globally 
consistent regulatory approach, our findings 
provide important insights and evidence on 
public expectations surrounding the regulatory 
landscape for AI. 
They reveal a clear public mandate for robust, fit-
for-purpose AI regulation underpinned by globally 
shared concerns surrounding the societal risks 
and negative outcomes from AI, and low public 
trust in the safety and security of AI use. 
The majority of people in all countries expect a 
multipronged regulatory approach, supporting 
both international and national laws and 
regulation, and expecting government and existing 
regulators to play a leading role. They also expect 
industry to be involved, working together with 
government and regulatory bodies through co-
regulation, and aligning organizational governance. 
The near universal endorsement and preference 
for international-level laws and regulation 
indicates public recognition that AI is not bound 
by national borders and is often developed by 
multinational companies who operate cross-
border, which can constrain the ability of a 
national government or regulatory body to 
develop and enforce regulation. International 
standards (e.g. from the International Standards 
Organization [ISO]) can provide governments 
and industry with interoperable frameworks for 
regulation and governance. 
In contrast to these expectations, the majority 
view the current regulatory landscape as 
inadequate and falling short in making AI use safe.
This gap between public expectations and the 
current regulatory landscape likely reflects 
the early stage of regulatory design and 
implementation in many jurisdictions. It may also 
partly reflect low public awareness of existing 
applicable laws in countries where these exist. 
To consider and remedy this gap, policymakers 
need to not only design, implement and enforce 
appropriate AI regulation, but also to educate 
and raise public awareness of these laws. This 
includes clarifying and raising awareness of how 
existing laws (e.g. privacy and consumer laws) 
apply to AI in countries where these are in place, 
and the rights and responsibilities that each 
individual has, as well as the responsibilities of 
organizations and governments to manage and 
enforce the laws.58 For example, some people 
may not know that under the EU AI Act they have 
a right to know when they are interacting with 
certain AI applications (e.g. chatbots). 
When people believe there are adequate 
regulatory safeguards, they are considerably 
more likely to trust and accept the use of AI, 
underscoring the importance of having an 
effective regulatory framework in place and 
ensuring it is communicated widely to those that 
are governed by it. A clear and effective regulatory 
framework and coordinated international 
responses provides industry with certainty 
and supports sustained safe use and adoption, 
as well as interoperability across countries.

Our findings reinforce that AI-generated 
misinformation is a key concern globally59 and is 
undermining trust in online content and raising 
concerns about the integrity of elections. There 
is strong public support for legislative measures 
to combat AI-generated misinformation, with the 
public also expecting media and social media 
companies to implement stronger fact-checking 
and techniques to enable the detection of AI-
generated content (e.g. watermarking). These 
expectations stand in contrast with moves by 
some social media companies to reduce fact-
checking on their platforms.60
Combatting misinformation and supporting 
the public’s ability to detect content generated 
and spread by AI bots is critical to supporting 
well-functioning democratic processes and 
societal cohesion. The widespread adoption of 
increasingly sophisticated generative AI tools is 
likely to make fake content easier to produce and 
disseminate, yet harder to detect.
The age of working with AI is here: 
implications for organizational leaders 
and employees
Our findings indicate that the age of working 
with AI is here, with high rates of self-reported 
employee and organizational adoption particularly in 
emerging economies, and a preference for human-
AI collaboration in managerial decision making.
The use of AI at work is delivering clear 
performance-related benefits ranging from 
productivity gains, better resource utilization, 
greater access to information, enhanced 
innovation and knowledge sharing, and increased 
revenue-generation opportunities. These benefits 
are indicators of the return on investment that 
can be realized from adopting AI technology.
However, our research indicates that these 
benefits are not guaranteed and are often 
accompanied by a concerning pattern of 
complacent, inappropriate, and non-transparent 
use of AI by employees, which augment 
material and reputational risks for organizations, 
leaders, and employees alike. Compounding 
this complacent use is lagging organizational 
governance and support for responsible AI use.61
For example, while most employees are using 
public generative AI tools, many organizations do 
not provide any policy to guide their use, despite 
the risks these public tools pose for privacy 
Key considerations for policymakers 
and regulators
•	 Analyze gaps in current regulation 
and laws.
•	 Accelerate the development and 
implementation of effective and 
enforceable AI regulation at the national 
and international level. 
•	 Collaborate with trusted technical experts 
to ensure regulation is effective and 
enforceable.
•	 Support international coordination and 
cooperation to ensure consistent global 
standards, interoperability, and mitigation 
of AI risks.
•	 Communicate and raise public 
awareness of legal rights, protections and 
responsibilities that relate to common 
applications of AI.
•	 Invest in public AI training and education to 
support AI literacy and responsible use.
•	 Invest in methods to combat mis- and 
disinformation.
Key actions for media and social 
media companies
•	 Invest in fact-checking and other 
mechanisms to combat mis- and

and data leakage, loss of IP, and cybersecurity 
concerns. Even when policies are in place, a 
worrying number of employees say they are 
using these tools in ways that contravene 
policies and rules, put company and customer 
data at risk, and raise quality issues. The invisible 
nature of much of employees’ individual AI work 
practices limits the ability to understand and 
harness the benefits and manage the risks. 
While many organizations are still at an early 
stage of their journey with AI62, these findings 
suggest a significant gap between employee 
individual adoption and organizational awareness 
and preparedness. There is an urgent imperative 
to close this gap.

Our research suggests that organizations can 
encourage AI adoption, while simultaneously 
promoting critical engagement with AI tools 
to combat complacent use, by cultivating an AI 
strategy and culture, implementing responsible 
AI governance mechanisms, and supporting 
employee AI training, literacy and understanding 
of AI capabilities, limitations and standards of 
responsible use. Each element is critical: the 
benefits of AI adoption and integration are more 
likely to be realized when organizations have each 
of these strategic, cultural, governance and training 
mechanisms in place.
There are many resources to help organizations 
support the development and implementation of 
robust AI governance systems, including several 
ISO AI Standards.63 By simultaneously encouraging 
experimentation and mandating responsible 
oversight, organizations can foster a sustainable 
ecosystem of innovation and performance benefits 
without sacrificing the reflection and scrutiny that 
is critical for responsible use.
Transparency and accountability are critical to 
combat inappropriate use. This requires clear 
guidance, policy, training, and oversight, and 
also a psychologically safe environment where 
employees feel comfortable to openly share 
how and when they are using AI tools in their 
work. This psychological safety not only enables 
better oversight and risk management but 
can also support a culture of shared learning, 
experimentation, continuous improvement, and 
the responsible diffusion of innovation across 
the organization (e.g. through communities 
of practice), helping to realize more of the 
performance benefits offered by AI technologies. 
Achieving this requires investment in structures 
and strategies to meaningfully engage with, 
listen to, and have honest conversations with 
employees about AI use and deployment.64 
Our findings further reinforce that high levels 
of trust and use of AI are not simply end goals. 
Rather, employees can be supported to develop 
appropriate levels of trust based on an informed 
understanding of the capabilities, limitations and 
risks of the AI system, and its appropriateness 
to the task at hand. Fully integrating training 
and guidance on responsible AI practices into 
everyday workflows—including onboarding 
processes, project work, and performance 
reviews—can help set healthy workplace 
norms around responsible AI use and support 
employees to develop well-calibrated trust.
Most employees surveyed want to learn more 
about AI, which can serve as a springboard to 
upskilling. Our research also suggests employees 
with low levels of AI literacy—such as older 
employees and those with lower incomes and 
no university education—may be at risk of 
experiencing what has been termed the ‘AI divide’: 
being left behind due to a lack of access or ability to 
use AI and benefit from the opportunities it offers.
AI adoption in the workplace is also having mixed 
impacts on human collaboration, stress and 
workload, employee surveillance, deskilling, and 
job security. Proactive management is required 
to help ensure that AI integration enhances 
rather than undermines trust, wellbeing, and skill 
development at work. For example, through work 
design that incorporates human–AI collaboration 
while preserving human relationships, strategic 
workforce planning and reskilling to support job 
security, and the ongoing development of human 
capabilities to mitigate deskilling and overreliance. 
A critical way organizations can help to strengthen 
stakeholder trust is by designing and using AI 
in ways that create demonstrable benefits and 
value for stakeholders, as well as by investing 
in assurance mechanisms that support and 
signal trustworthy use. The research indicates 
that people are more willing to trust AI systems 
when assurance mechanisms are in place, such 
as meaningful human oversight and accountability 
that enables over-riding or challenging AI 
recommendations, monitoring of system reliability, 
adhering to international AI standards, 
and independent third-party AI assurance. 
To date, much of the governance of AI has focused 
on the integration of AI into services, products 
and operations, and ensuring the principles of 
trustworthy AI (such as those reflected in the 
assurance mechanisms), are put into practice.65 
The research highlights the need to complement 
this governance with greater attention to 
employee use of AI and the impacts on work. 
Specifically, they highlight a need for organizations 
to better govern how employees are using AI 
tools and systems in their everyday work to create 
greater accountability and transparency, and to 
proactively manage and monitor the impacts 
of AI integration in the workplace.

Educating for an AI-augmented future: 
Implications for education providers, 
students, and employers
The findings reveal that AI use among students 
is pervasive, frequent, and driven primarily by 
freely available general-purpose generative 
AI tools. Students are clearly benefiting from 
from increased efficiency, enhanced access 
to information, greater innovation, more 
personalized learning, and reduced workloads 
and stress. However, students also report mixed 
cognitive, social-relational, and fairness impacts, 
and widespread inappropriate or complacent 
use of AI.
The implications of these mixed impacts are 
profound. While AI helps content production and 
efficient completion of learning and assessment 
tasks, it may also weaken the development of 
critical thinking, interpersonal skills, and social 
dynamics such as collaboration and interaction—all 
of which are critical life skills. Without intervention 
and management, students—the workforce 
of the future—are likely to be tech-savvy with 
well-developed AI capabilities, yet potentially 
underprepared for work that requires collaboration, 
strong interpersonal skills, critical thinking and 
completion of work without AI assistance.

For education providers, these findings emphasize 
the need for robust and explicit AI governance 
frameworks, as well as educational programs 
that develop students’ critical engagement with 
AI technologies. The findings suggest many 
educational providers are lagging behind in 
establishing clear guidance for their students, 
highlighting the need to proactively develop, 
integrate, and communicate AI policies and 
provide appropriate training to support responsible 
use and preserve the core educational outcomes 
essential to students’ long-term success. 
More broadly, the rise of AI is challenging 
conventional teaching models, suggesting 
a need for ongoing curriculum adaptation to 
ensure students are equipped with the skills 
to navigate an AI-augmented world, while 
continuing to develop their uniquely human 
capabilities. Educators must equip students for a 
workplace where AI is a ubiquitous tool, ensuring 
they develop both human-AI collaboration 
proficiency, together with the essential human 
skills that underpin leadership, innovation, 
collaboration, and ethical decision-making.
Simply banning AI use is not a viable option. 
Instead, teaching students how to question, 
verify, and critically engage with AI tools is a 
critical skillset for the future of work. Ultimately, 
the proliferation of student AI use leaves 
education providers little choice but to reimagine 
a new educational paradigm. This may require 
prioritizing collaborative assignments and in-
person engagement to ensure interpersonal 
skill development and redesigning assessment 
methods towards more interactive, process-
oriented evaluations (e.g. oral exams, in-class 
problem-solving tasks) and AI-assisted but 
human-verified work.Fostering a culture of 
academic integrity—where students see AI 
as an aid rather than a shortcut to developing 
their skills, knowledge and capabilities—will 
be equally crucial. 
These insights may also have implications for 
the workplace. It will pose a significant challenge 
for employers if students—as the workforce of 
the future—bring with them engrained norms of 
inappropriate AI use and ways of working that are 
at odds with organizational responsibilities. This 
reinforces the need for AI education, literacy and 
critical engagement with AI technologies to start 
early and be core to educational programs.
Key actions for education providers:
•	 Develop and communicate robust 
governance frameworks for the 
responsible use of AI in learning 
and assessment.
•	 Develop curricula and pedagogy that 
integrate AI literacy, human-AI collaboration 
skills, and critical evaluation of AI systems 
balanced with the development of uniquely 
human capabilities such as collaboration, 
teamwork, problem solving, and 
ethical reasoning.
•	 Use assessment methods that preserve 
academic integrity and skill development.
•	 Collaborate with industry to ensure 
educational curricula prepares students 
for the future of work.
Key actions for students:
•	 Engage with AI tools ethically, 
transparently, and in accordance with 
institutional guidelines. 
•	 Take initiative to learn how AI systems 
work, understand their limitations, and 
critically evaluate their outputs.
•	 View AI as a tool to support learning, not 
a shortcut: use it purposefully to develop 
skills, knowledge and capabilities.
Loss of human interaction due to AI is a 
significant societal concern. It is experienced 
by most people, including employees and 
students who report using AI rather than 
collaborating with others to complete work, 
raising the question of how human connectivity 
can be retained in AI-augmented workplaces, 
educational environments, and society at large. 
This particular challenge is less amenable to 
training, governance, or technical solutions. It 
leaves organizations to grapple with building and 
preserving meaningful connectivity, purpose, and 
belonging amidst increasingly virtual work and 
service delivery environments and a drive toward 
enhancing efficiency through AI-empowered 
technological solutions. Deliberate strategies

to maintain human connections will become 
increasingly essential, not only for attraction and 
retention of employees, but also for fostering a 
culture of collaboration and shared responsibility 
that underpins meaningful work, sustained 
performance, and broader societal wellbeing. 
There is no easy fix: addressing these challenges 
demands sustained organizational commitment 
and intentional strategies to balance technological 
efficiency with human-centric practices. 
Education providers and employers have a shared 
interest in ensuring people use AI effectively, 
responsibly, and in ways that enhance human 
potential and have positive societal outcomes. 
Education providers can lay the foundation by 
socializing students in responsible use and 
critical evaluation of when, where and how to 
appropriately use it. Organizations can reinforce 
and build upon this understanding through 
workplace practices, norms, governance, training 
and professional development. A cross-sectoral 
approach—rooted in shared responsibility and 
mutual learning among students, education 
providers, leaders, and employees—is important 
to ensure the next generation enters the 
workforce not only AI-capable, but also AI-wise.
Re-imagining the AI-enabled society: 
stewarding the responsible integration 
of AI requires a shared commitment 
The public’s shared concerns about AI stem 
broadly from three sources: AI malfunctions 
(e.g. bias, inaccurate outcomes, system failure), 
malicious or misleading use (e.g. misinformation 
and disinformation, manipulation or harmful use, 
cybersecurity risks), and inappropriate, reckless 
or overuse (e.g. deskilling and dependency, loss 
of human interaction, loss of privacy or IP).66 
Addressing and mitigating these root 
causes requires a range of technical, social, 
organizational, regulatory, and individual actions, 
highlighting the need for a coordinated approach 
at multiple levels. While our survey suggests the 
negative outcomes from AI are experienced less 
than the benefits, there is an argument that even 
the lowest experienced negative outcomes (i.e. 
bias and unfair treatment; experienced by a third) 
is unacceptable, and there is a moral obligation to 
do better.
These negative outcomes are being experienced 
or observed by a significant proportion of people 
across each of the 47 countries, indicating that 
these are no longer ‘potential’ risks: rather they 
are realized impacts. These negative impacts are of 
universal concern across the countries surveyed, 
and there is broad support for international 
cooperation and efforts to address them. 
The tension between the undeniable positive 
benefits from AI and the realized negative impacts 
raises questions about the kind of society and 
organizations we want to achieve with AI. Our 
survey shows that we are reaping the rewards of 
efficiency, effectiveness, innovation, and resource 
savings, but are also experiencing loss of human 
connection, privacy, mis- and disinformation, 
deskilling and dependency. We do not yet fully 
understand the long-term impacts, underscoring 
the importance of considered choices at every 
level about how AI is integrated into society 
and work. 
We hope this research will support individuals 
and organizations to make choices that practically 
resolve this tension in favor of AI’s benefits and 
inform a clearer vision of how an AI-enabled 
society can meet the needs and expectations of 
the public and support people and communities 
to thrive.

In this section, we explain the 
research methodology and 
statistical approach
Survey piloting, translations and 
procedure 
The research was approved by and adhered to 
the Guidelines of the ethical review process of 
The University of Queensland and the National 
Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research. 
The survey was divided into five sections 
with questions in each section focused on 
the respondent’s: a) demographic details; 
b) understanding of AI; c) use and attitudes 
toward AI systems (including trust, acceptance, 
risks, benefits, impacts and emotions); d) 
attitudes toward AI regulation, governance and 
management; e) attitudes, use and impacts of 
AI at work (only completed by those working) or 
in education (only completed by those studying). 
At the end of the survey, respondents were 
asked a series of open-ended questions.
After completing the first section on use 
and understanding of AI, participants read the 
definition of AI adapted from the OECD (see 
page 16), followed by a description of common 
ways AI is used to ensure understanding: 
“AI is used in a range of applications that do 
things such as generate text, images, and 
videos, predict what customers will buy, 
identify credit card fraud, identify people 
from their photos, help diagnose disease, 
and enable self-driving cars.” 
Questions in sections c and d of the survey 
referred to one of three specific AI applications or 
referred to ‘AI systems in general’. Respondents 
were randomly allocated to one of these AI 
applications, providing equivalent numbers of 
responses across each. Before answering these 
questions, respondents read a brief description 
of the AI application, including what it is used 
for, what it does and how it works (see full 
descriptions on page 16). The research team 
developed these descriptions based on a range of 
in-use systems with input from domain experts 
working in healthcare, Human Resources, and 
generative AI.
The survey was extensively piloted and refined 
before launch to ensure clarity and construct 
validity and reliability.67 To ensure survey 
equivalence across countries, we conducted 
translation and back-translation of the English 
version of the survey into the native language(s) 
dominant in each country, using separate 
professional translators. Respondents could also 
opt to complete the survey in English if preferred. 
To enhance the rigor and quality of the research, 
we applied established techniques to filter out 
inattentive survey responses.68 Individuals with 
rapid completion times suggestive of insufficient 
engagement were removed. We included 
attention checks at two points in the survey. 
Respondents were excluded if they failed these 
checks or failed one while also exhibiting straight-
lining behaviors (e.g. consistently selecting 
the same response across multiple survey 
items), nonsensical open-ended responses, or 
implausible answers across related question sets.

Survey measures
Where possible, we used or adapted existing 
validated measures from academic research 
(e.g. Haesvoets et al., 2021; Harmon-Jones et 
al., 2016; McKnight et al., 2002, 2011; Lee & 
Park, 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Zhang & Moffat, 
2015) or from previous public attitude surveys 
(e.g. Ipsos, 2017; Zhang & Dafoe, 2019). 
Trust in each specific AI application was 
measured using a reliable 7-item scale adapted 
from Gillespie (2012) and validated in our prior 
surveys. Example items are: “How willing 
are you to… Rely on information or content 
provided by an AI system” (willingness to rely); 
“Share relevant information about yourself to 
enable an AI system to perform a service or 
task for you” (willingness to share information); 
“Trust AI systems” (direct trust). Perceived 
trustworthiness was measured using a 9-item 
measure assessing positive expectations toward 
the AI system, adapted from McKnight et al. 
(2002). Example items include “I believe most 
AI applications: Produce output that is accurate” 
(ability); “Are safe and secure to use” (safe and 
ethical use). 
AI literacy was assessed using two indicators. 
AI knowledge was measured with four items 
adapted from Ipsos (2017) that assessed people’s 
belief that they feel informed about how AI is 
used, understand when AI is being used, feel 
they know about AI, and feel they have the skills 
and knowledge to use AI appropriately. AI efficacy 
was assessed with a 6-item measure adapted 
from validated subjective AI literacy scales (Lee & 
Park, 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Three items relate 
to the ability to use AI effectively (e.g. “I can… 
Skillfully use AI applications or products to help 
me with my daily work or activities”) and three 
to the ability to use AI responsibly (e.g. “Identify 
potential ethical issues associated with the use 
of AI applications”). This was supplemented with 
an objective measure of people’s knowledge 
of AI use in common applications by asking 
respondents whether three common AI 
applications (social media, virtual assistants, and 
facial recognition) use AI (yes, no or don't know).
Income was measured with a simplified version 
of the income question used by the World 
Values Survey (WVS; see Haerpfer et al., 2022). 
Specifically, we asked: “Please indicate which 
income group best describes your household 
income (counting all wages, salaries, pensions and 
other income sources).” Responses were provided 
on a 1-10 scale, where 1 = Lowest income group, 
5 = Middle income group, and 10 = Highest income 
group. There was also a ‘Prefer not to say’ option.
Most survey measures used either a 5 or 7-point 
Likert scale (e.g., ranging from strongly disagree 
(1) to strongly agree (7)). The psychometric 
properties of all multi-item constructs were 
assessed to examine reliability and dimensionality. 
Each measure met the criteria for reliability, 
with Cronbach alphas ranging from .81 (critical 
engagement with AI) to .96 (organizational support 
for responsible AI). 
Data analysis, statistical testing 
and reporting 
For ease of interpretation, percentages are 
reported in most places rather than means. 
When percentages did not add up to 100 percent 
due to rounding, we distributed the remaining value 
based on decreasing order of the values’ decimal 
part, as per the Largest Remainder Method. 
Some survey response scales provided a 
‘don’t know’ option. When 5 percent or more of 
respondents selected this option, we include it 
in the reporting of percentages. When less than 
5 percent, we remove these responses for ease 
of interpretation and recalculate percentages 
based on the remainder of the data.
Correlational analyses and structural equation 
modeling were conducted to examine 
associations between concepts. All correlations 
reported in-text are significant at p<.001. 
Reported relationships are based on theoretical 
or hypothesized relationships. Given the data 
is cross-sectional and self-reported, causality 
between concepts cannot and should not 
be inferred.
Our reporting of between-country, between-
application, between-people and within-person 
differences was based on statistical testing and 
adhered to well established benchmarks for 
interpreting between- and within-subject effect 
sizes (see Cohen, 1988; Lakens, 2013).

We used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
to examine differences between countries, 
AI applications and people (e.g. age category 
differences). We took several steps to ensure 
the responsible reporting of only meaningful 
differences in the data. First, we adopted a 
stringent cut-off of p<.001 to interpret statistical 
significance. Where there were statistically 
significant differences between groups, we 
examined the partial eta-squared effect size 
to determine the magnitude of differences 
between the groups. Given the large sample 
size, trivial effects can reach statistical 
significance; thus, we report only those findings 
with effect sizes of .03 or greater to focus on 
relationships that are substantively meaningful. 
This threshold ensures that reported findings 
reflect meaningful differences.69
We performed paired-sample t-tests to examine 
within-person differences (for instance, the 
variability in perceptions of the technical ability 
of AI systems and their safe and ethical use). 
We used a measure of effect size to determine 
the magnitude of statistically significant effects. 
Specifically, we used Hedges’ g with a cut-
off of .30 to indicate a robust and practically 
meaningful difference.70
Changes over time in the 17 countries surveyed 
in both 2022 and 2024 are based on survey 
questions asked about three common AI use 
applications: AI in general, Healthcare AI, and 
Human Resources AI. As such, comparative 
data presented is based only on the three AI 
applications. Questions about generative AI 
were only asked in 2024. Additionally, some 
measures were modified between 2022 and 
2024, with items added or removed. For these 
measures, composite values were recalculated 
using only items that remained the same or 
were substantively similar across both surveys.71
Because the samples at each time point are 
independent rather than longitudinal, changes 
over time should be interpreted as indicative of 
broad trends. We report statistically significant 
differences (p<.001) in Appendix 4 and illustrate 
the largest changes in the main text. While we 
use stringent effect size thresholds (e.g. n² ≥ .03) 
in cross-sectional analyses to ensure that only 
substantively large differences are highlighted, 
in repeated cross-sectional studies even small 
but statistically significant changes can signal 
consistent and informative population-level trends.

Overall and country demographic profiles 
The demographic profile of each country sample 
was nationally representative of the population 
on age, gender and regional location, within a 
5 percent margin of error, based on official national 
statistics within each country. The few exceptions 
are noted below.
Across countries, the gender balance was 
51 percent women, 49 percent men and <1 
percent other genders, with Costa Rica, Latvia, 
and Portugal having the highest representation 
of women (54%) and UAE the lowest (32%).
The mean age across countries was 46 years and 
ranged from 35 years (Costa Rica and Saudi Arabia) 
to 53 years (Japan). There was difficulty in reaching 
over-65-year-olds in eight countries: China (over 65s 
expected: 17%, achieved: 10%), Egypt (expected: 
9%, achieved: 5%), Greece (expected: 27%, 
achieved: 16%), Israel (expected: 18%, achieved: 
11%), Lithuania (expected: 25%, achieved: 14%), 
Portugal (expected: 27%, achieved: 17%), Slovenia 
(expected: 27%, achieved: 11%), and Türkiye 
(expected: 13%, achieved: 7%). Respondents from 
China, Egypt, and Nigeria also tended to be more 
urban than the general population. We were unable 
to source reliable location data for the UAE and 
Slovenia. Data collected in Israel did not include 
the West Bank settlement and data collected in 
China was contained to mainland China. 
Country samples represented the full diversity 
of education levels. While levels of university 
education broadly matched the respective 
populations in most advanced economies, country 
samples tended to overrepresent university-
educated people in emerging economies relative 
to their respective general populations (using 
OECD 2024 education data as a comparison72). It is 
common for online survey respondents in countries 
with emerging economies to be better educated, 
as well as more urban, younger, and affluent, than 
those in the general population in those countries.73
Given non-representativeness related to age 
and education in some of our country samples, 
we performed additional robustness checks to 
ensure differences reported across countries and 
economies are not merely artifacts of differences 
in age or education. We examined differences 
between emerging and advanced economies—and 
countries—on key indicators when controlling for 
the effects of education and age, using multivariate 
analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) tests. The pattern 
of results did not change; when we report economy 
and country differences, these remain significant 
and meaningful when controlling for education and 
age. These analyses indicate that the observed 
differences across countries and economies are not 
simply due to demographic differences in age or 
education across country samples.
Employee demographic profile
Sixty-seven percent of the total sample were 
employed (52% full-time; 15% part-time), yielding 
32,352 respondents answering questions about 
AI use at work. The proportion of employees 
ranged from 50 percent (Belgium, Finland) to 
89 percent (UAE). Among workers, 53 percent 
were male and 47 percent female, with a mean 
age of 41 (range = 18-95). Most were employed 
by an organization (77%), followed by self-
employment (16%) and business ownership (7%). 
Respondents worked across diverse industries 
(e.g. power and utilities = 2%, manufacturing = 
11%) and occupations (e.g. service and sales = 
10%, professional and skilled = 32%).
Student demographic profile
Students comprised 5% of the sample (n = 2,499), 
with 56 percent female and 44 percent male. 
The mean age was 23 (range = 18-86), with 65% 
enrolled in university, 18% in secondary education, 
16% in vocational, trade, or technical programs, 
and 1% in other forms of education. Student 
respondents were present in all countries (range = 
28 [Switzerland] to 115 [Nigeria]). Country-level and 
economic group analyses were not conducted, 
due to the small subsample sizes.

5	 Intentional use was differentiated 
from the passive use of AI (e.g. when 
AI operates behind the scenes in 
tools such as email filters and search 
engines). General-purpose generative 
AI tools were the most common class 
of AI intentionally used at work. We use 
the term as defined and explained in this 
report by the European Parliament.
6	 We adopted the International Monetary 
Fund’s (IMF) classification of advanced 
and emerging economies.
7	 Robustly answering the question 
of which countries are leading AI 
adoption and use requires a different 
methodology to public attitude surveys. 
The conclusions here are based on the 
perceptions and experiences reported 
by a representative sampling of the 
public. They are not based on objective 
indicators of AI adoption, investment, or 
AI education and training.
8	 To define global regions, we draw from 
the United Nations (2023). Standard 
Country or Area Codes for Statistical 
Use (49).
9	 Survey responses were collected from 
individuals in mainland China only, 
excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
10	We focused primarily on the 2023 
Government AI Readiness Index. This 
index ranks and provides a total score 
for 193 countries on AI readiness across 
three pillars: Government (e.g. existence 
of a national AI strategy, cyber-
security), Technology (e.g. number of AI 
unicorns, R&D spending), and Data and 
Infrastructure (e.g. telecommunications 
infrastructure, households with internet 
access). The countries selected had 
rankings at or near the top for their 
region on the 2023 Government AI 
Readiness Index. We supplemented 
this with data from the 2024 Stanford 
AI Index, which examines country-level 
private investment in AI and acceleration 
in AI activity over time to enable the 
identification of countries that are rapidly 
emerging in AI in regions that historically 
lacked AI capacity and investment (e.g. 
South Africa, Brazil, India, Mexico, 
Portugal, the UAE, etc.).
11	 See Adams, R., Adeleke, F., Florido, 
A., de Magalhães Santos, L. G., 
Grossman, N., Junck, L., & Stone, K. 
(2024). Global Index on Responsible AI 
2024 (1st Edition). South Africa: Global 
Center on AI Governance. https://girai-
report-2024-corrected-edition.tiiny.
site/ This index assesses responsible 
AI governance across 138 countries, 
measuring human rights protections, 
AI governance policy, and institutional 
capacities through government actions, 
frameworks, and non-state actor 
initiatives.
12	 China is considered an emerging 
economy by the IMF despite its large 
size and economic power because, 
while it has experienced rapid GDP 
growth and industrialization, its per 
capita income remains significantly 
lower than developed nations, indicating 
that its economy is still transitioning 
toward a fully developed state; this is 
further supported by factors like ongoing 
economic reforms, a large developing 
market, and a focus on infrastructure 
development.
13	Data was collected from representative 
research panels sourced by Dynata, a 
global leader in survey research panel 
provision.
14	Income was assessed using a question 
from the World Values Survey Group 
(WVS; Haerpfer et al., 2022). It was self-
reported on a 10-point scale from 1 = 
Lowest income group to 10 = Highest 
income group with a ‘Prefer not to say’ 
option. For demographic analysis, we re-
coded responses into three categories: 
Low = 1-3, Medium = 4-7, High = 8-10. 
This is aligned with WVS categorization.
15	Occupational groupings were 
sourced from the International Labor 
Organization’s International Standard 
Classifications of Occupations.
16	We adapted and simplified the definition 
to make it accessible to a broad and 
diverse range of people with varying 
levels of reading ability, while retaining 
key defining elements. See discussion 
of the evolution of the OECD definition 
of AI in: What is AI? Can you make a 
clear distinction between AI and non-
AI systems? Across this report, the 
terms “AI” and “AI System” are used 
interchangeably for simplicity.
17	 Four of the 17 countries surveyed 
at both time points are emerging 
economies: Brazil, China, India, and 
South Africa. However, as there is no 
clear differences between advanced 
and emerging economies in changes 
over time, so we do not distinguish 
between them in reporting the findings 
of change.
18	Responses to the four items assessing 
AI knowledge were aggregated to 
produce an overall score.

19	In support of this interpretation, 
the 2024 Stanford AI Index reports 
accelerated use and adoption of AI in 
several emerging economies, as well 
as the increasing economic importance 
of AI in these countries. Our pattern 
of findings aligns with a recent Ipsos/
Google survey that demonstrates AI use 
and positive attitudes are particularly 
high in emerging economies.
20	This definition aligns with dominant 
interdisciplinary definitions of trust (e.g. 
Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau et al., 2009), 
including trust in technological systems 
(see McKnight et al., 2002, 2011).
21	Perceptions of trustworthiness 
are typically higher than trusting 
intentions because trust involves risk 
and vulnerability (e.g. by relying on AI 
output or sharing information with an AI 
system), whereas perceiving a system as 
trustworthy does not. There is a strong 
association between the perceived 
trustworthiness of AI systems and 
trusting AI systems (r=.79).
22	We also find people are more willing 
to share information with healthcare AI 
systems (57%, M=4.5), than rely on the 
output of these systems (48%, M=4.2), 
reflecting the expectation that sharing 
information with healthcare providers 
and systems is a routine and necessary 
part of health care provision. We find this 
difference between willingness to share 
information and rely on AI systems 
across applications.
23	Norway’s high level of trust in AI systems, 
compared to many other advanced 
economies, may reflect Norwegians’ 
comparatively high levels of AI training 
and literacy, workplace adoption of 
AI, trust in government use of AI, and 
awareness of laws and regulation relating 
to AI, as evidenced in this report.
24	The 2024 Stanford AI Index reports 
accelerated use and adoption of AI in 
several emerging economies, as well as 
the increasing economic importance of AI 
in these countries. Our pattern of findings 
aligns with a recent Ipsos/Google survey 
that demonstrates AI use and positive 
attitudes are particularly high in emerging 
economies.
25	We asked questions related to the 
experience or observation of benefits and 
risks only of people who reported they 
had experience with the AI application 
they were allocated, i.e. AI systems (59% 
reported experience; Emerging = 68%. 
Advanced = 55%), Generative AI (50% 
experienced; Emerging = 60%, Advanced 
= 45%), AI use in Human Resources 
(21% experienced; Emerging = 31%, 
Advanced = 15%), or AI use in Healthcare 
(18% experienced; Emerging = 28%, 
Advanced = 13%).
26	Some benefits were observed or 
experienced more in relation to the use of 
AI in Human Resources and Healthcare. 
Specifically, people had experienced or 
observed increased fairness from AI use 
in Human Resources and Healthcare 
(62-64%) more so than from Generative 
AI tools or AI systems in general (41%-
42%), and reduced costs and better 
use of resources from AI use in Human 
Resources and Healthcare (68-74%) 
compared to Generative AI or AI 
systems (59-60%).
27	The list of risks and benefits was the 
outcome of extensive survey piloting 
including analysis of open-ended 
questions asking about benefits and 
risks of AI systems.
28	Independent surveys showing public 
desire for regulation include: The Ada 
Lovelace Institute and The Alan Turing 
Institute (2025). How do people feel 
about AI? Wave two of a nationally 
representative survey of UK attitudes 
to AI. Eurobarometer (2025). Artificial 
Intelligence and the future of work. Saeri, 
A., Noetel, M., & Graham, J. (2024). 
Survey Assessing Risks from Artificial 
Intelligence (Technical Report). Rethink 
Priorities (2023). US public opinion of AI 
policy and risk.
29	Ipsos (2024). Public trust in AI: 
Implications for policy and regulation. 
Seth, J. (2024). Public Perception of AI: 
Sentiment and Opportunity.
30	One of the most significant reforms to 
legislation and regulation of AI is the 
EU AI Act, which governs members of 
the European Union. This act officially 
entered into force on 1 August 2024, and 
intends to be fully applicable by 2 August 
2026, with some exceptions. We found 
no difference in the perceived adequacy 
of regulation or awareness of regulation 
between people in countries governed 
by the EU AI Act and people in other 
countries with advanced economies. 
This likely reflects that our data collection 
preceded the practical implementation of 
the obligations of the EU AI Act, which 
commenced on 2 February 2025.
31	Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a 
suite of multivariate techniques that offers 
advantages over other regression-based 
approaches. It explicitly accounts for 
measurement error to yield less biased 
estimates, estimates latent constructs 
from observed indicators, and evaluates 
the fit between the model and the data. 
Our model fit the data well: x2 (N = 
46524, df = 2272) = 113119.70, p < .001; 
CFI: .94, TLI: .94, SRMR: .07, RMSEA: .03. 
For an accessible guide to the structural 
equation modeling process, see Kline, 
R. B. (2023). Principles and Practices of 
Structural Equation Modeling (5th ed.). 
Guilford Press: New York.
32	‘B’ refers to the standardized beta 
coefficient, which indicates the strength 
of the effect of each independent variable 
(i.e., driver) on the dependent variable 
(i.e., outcome). Beta coefficients can be 
compared to indicate the relative strength 
of each independent variable. B=.43 from 
trust to acceptance means that if trust 
increases by one standard deviation, 
acceptance is expected to increase by 
about .43 standard deviations.

additional AI literacy metrics to better

The replication of the model using the 
current data collected from 47 countries 
speaks to the robustness of the model.

38	See appendix 2 for further details of the 
employee sample.
39	As participants could select multiple 
options, the percentages sum to more 
than 100%. These options were derived 
from thematic analysis of the key 
reasons for not using AI identified by 
employees during our two pilot studies 
conducted to inform and validate the 
survey questions. We also included an 
‘other’ option in our global survey to 
capture participants qualitative reasons 
for not using AI, which was completed 
by 360 participants. Thematic analysis 
of this data revealed the majority (78%) 
of reasons overlapped with the options 
reported here.
40	There is no difference across economic 
groups in the use of publicly available tools 
(71% in emerging economies vs. 70% 
in advanced) or tools managed by one’s 
organization (43% vs. 41%, respectively).
41	 A caveat is that these differences 
between economic groups may, in part, 
reflect that employees in emerging 
economies have higher levels of AI 
training and literacy, resulting in a greater 
understanding of AI and when and how 
it is used at work, rather than the actual 
use of AI by the organization.
42	Social desirability bias refers to the 
tendency for research subjects to 
give socially desirable responses to 
sensitive questions instead of providing 
responses that reflect their true feelings 
or experiences (see Grimm, 2010, for 
an overview).
43	See, for example: Chesley, N. (2014).

technology use, work intensification 
and employee strain and distress. Work, 
Employment and Society, 28 (4), 589-

in industry 4.0 led organizations. 
International Journal of Manpower, 
43 (2), 334-354.
44	See, for example: Weibel, A., Den Hartog, 
D., Gillespie, N., Searle, R., Six, F., & 
Skinner, D. (2016). How do Controls Impact 
Employee Trust in the Employer? Human 
Resource Management, 55 (3), 437-462.
45	We adapted a measure from Haesevoets, 
de Cremer, Dierckx & van Hiel. (2021). 
Human-machine collaboration in 
managerial decision making. Computers 
in Human Behavior, 119.
46	This finding also supports prior research 
reporting concerns about potential job 
losses resulting from AI and automation. 
For example: ADP Research Institute 
(2024). People at Work 2024: A Global 
Workforce View; Eurobarometer (2025). 
Artificial Intelligence and the future of 
work; Pew Research Center (2025). How 
the U.S. Public and AI Experts View 
Artificial Intelligence.
47	Organizational support of AI (AI strategy, 
culture, and support for AI literacy) 
has no discernible impact on critical 
engagement. This is likely because its 
power in predicting critical engagement 
is largely captured by the more direct 
measure of AI literacy.	
48	Given some groups of employees are 
significantly more likely to use AI at 
work, we controlled for AI use frequency 
when analyzing demographic influences 
on inappropriate and complacent use 
behaviors in multivariate analysis of 
covariance (MANCOVA) models. This is 
important because frequency of AI use at 
work is a strong predictor of complacent 
or inappropriate use of AI (effect size [n²] 
= .05 to .12). Without controlling for use, 
demographic effects may be inflated, 
reflecting greater exposure to AI rather 
than meaningful differences in how AI 
is used by different groups of people.	
49	The partial eta-squared effect size (n²) 
helps to explain the practical magnitude 
of the effect of one variable on another 
after considering the influence of other 
variables in the model. Effect sizes of 
.01, .06, .14 indicate small, medium, and 
large effects, respectively. The University 
of Cambridge’s MRC Cognition and 
Brain Sciences Unit provides a user-
friendly primer on effect sizes. See 
also see Lakens, D. (2013). Calculating 
and reporting effect sizes to facilitate 
cumulative science: A practical primer 
for t-tests and ANOVAS. Frontiers in 
Psychology, 4, 863	
50	Industry groups were adapted from 
the International Labour Organization 
International Standard Industrial 
Classification of all economic activities.
51	In a historical context, it can be viewed 
as normal early in the journey of adopting 
a powerful, disruptive and transformative 
technology for there to be a period 
of ambivalence and adjustment until 
appropriate standards, best practice, 
norms, governance and regulation 
emerges to guide development and 
use and mitigate harms.
52	See the European Commission’s (EC) 
outline of the European approach 
to artificial intelligence, which is 
underpinned by the EU AI Act. The EC 
notes that fostering excellence in AI will 
strengthen Europe’s ability to compete 
globally, and that trust is central to the 
vision of making the EU a world-class 
hub for AI while ensuring safety and 
fundamental rights.
53	As history has shown, this is not the 
first time a technology has created 
this tension, nor will it be the last time. 
See Frey, C. (2019). Technology Trap: 
Capital, Labor, and Power in the Age of 
Automation. Princeton University Press.
54	There is some evidence to suggest that 
practical application of responsible AI 
mechanisms remain at an early stage 
including in emerging economies. For 
examples, see Reul, A., Connolly, P.,

55	See Google’s 2024 report examining 
the economic potential of AI in 
emerging markets.
56 A recent Ipsos/Google survey also 
supports this view, showing that 
people in emerging economies—and 
particularly Nigeria—are more likely 
to think that AI will have a positive 
impact on the economy, suggesting 
positive perceptions of AI as a driver 
of economic prosperity.

Global Risks Report 2024 (19th ed.).

global-risks-report-2024
60	Meta is abandoning fact checking—this 
doesn’t bode well for the fight against 
misinformation; For further evidence-
based information on strategies for 
countering disinformation see Countering 
Disinformation Effectively: An Evidence-
Based Policy Guide | Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace
61	The levels of organizational support 
for responsible AI may be even lower 
in practice than how it is reported by 
employees. This perception-practice gap 
is illustrated by the 2024 Responsible 
AI Index, which found that while most 
executives believe their AI systems align 
with responsible AI principles, fewer 
than one-third had actively implemented 
responsible AI practices.
62	A 2024 Boston Consulting Group study 
found that only 26% of organizations 
surveyed have developed the necessary 
capabilities to move beyond proof-of-
concept and generate tangible AI value 
at scale.
63	For example, ISO Standards 42001, 
23894, and 38507 can all help 
organizations with their AI governance. 
Further, for an overview of over 900 
resources to support responsible AI use, 
see the OECD’s Tools for Trustworthy 
AI - OECD.AI.
64	Research by the Human Technology 
Institute at the University of Technology 
Sydney finds that many employees 
feel they are ""invisible bystanders"" 
in the adoption of AI into their work; 
that technology is imposed on them 
rather than being designed with them. 
The research recommends creating 
avenues for structured engagement 
with employees around AI deployment.
65	Current AI governance has heavily 
emphasized systemic issues—
addressing how AI systems are built and 
how they impact society at large—and 
comparatively less emphasis has been 
placed on regulating or guiding the 
use of AI by individuals. Major policy 
frameworks and principles—from the 
EU and OECD to national strategies—
emphasize themes such as fairness, 
transparency, safety, accountability, and 
human oversight, and typically target AI 
developers and deployers. Regarding 
AI use in organizations, see Bird & Bird 
(2025) AI Governance: Essential Insights 
for Organizations for analysis observing 
that most policies focus on high-level 
standards rather than providing granular 
guidance around training employees 
on AI governance or setting rules for 
employees’ day-to-day AI usage.

of AI Governance in Australia, Human 
Technology Institute, The University of 
Technology Sydney; see also International 
AI Safety Report (2025).
67	We received extensive feedback on 
the survey throughout its development 
from academic and industry experts 
and conducted two large-scale pilot 
tests (Pilot 1, N = 751 respondents 
from the UK, USA, and Australia; Pilot 
2, N = 793 respondents from the USA 
and UK). During these pilot tests, we 
specifically solicited feedback on the 
construct and face validity of new 
measures by providing respondents with 
definitions and asking them to assess 
whether these adequately covered the 
intended construct, as well as broader 
recommendations to enhance the survey.
68	Research suggests that using multiple 
indicators to determine respondent 
attentiveness is important:  Ward, M. 
K., & Meade, A. W. (2023). Dealing 
with careless responding in survey 
data: Prevention, identification, and 
recommended best practices. Annual 
Review of Psychology, 74(1), 577-596. 
Meade, A. W., & Craig, S. B. (2012). 
Identifying careless responses in survey 
data. Psychological Methods, 17(3), 
437. Oppenheimer, D. M., Meyvis, T., 
& Davidenko, N. (2009). Instructional 
manipulation checks: Detecting 
satisficing to increase statistical 
power. Journal of Experimental 
Social Psychology, 45(4), 867-872.
69	See Field, A. (2013). Discovering statistics 
using IBM SPSS statistics (4th ed.). Sage: 
London. (See page 474; values for w2 of 
.01, .06, .14 indicate small, medium, and 
large effects respectively).
70	As a rule of thumb, a Hedges' g value of 
.2 is considered a small effect size, .5 a 
medium effect size, and .8 or larger, a 
large effect size (see Lakens, D. (2013) 
Calculating and reporting effect sizes to 
facilitate cumulative science: A practical 
primer for t-tests and ANOVAS. Frontiers 
in Psychology, 4, 863). However, 
interpretation of effect sizes is subjective, 
and we have chosen a cut-off of .3 rather 
than .2 because this ensures a practically 
meaningful and robust difference which 
trends toward a medium, rather than a 
small effect.
71	 Respondents’ belief that their 
organization uses AI was asked in a yes/
no/don’t know format in 2022, while the 
extent of organizational use (ranging from 
1 = not at all to 5 = to a very large extent) 
was asked in 2024. As such, this variable 
was re-coded into use (responses = 
2-4) vs. no use (response = 1) in order to 
make meaningful comparisons. Similarly, 
employee AI use was measured slightly 
differently across time. Change in total 
use, rather than regular or semi-regular 
use, is reported.
72	Comparative data sourced from 
https://data-explorer.oecd.org/ or 
from https://databank.worldbank.org/
source/education-statistics:-Education-
Attainment where not available from 
OECD.
73	This is often a limitation of online public 
attitude surveys (e.g. see University 
of Oxford’s Reuters Institute report 
How we follow climate change: 
Climate news use and attitudes in eight 
countries, and the OECD's technical 
details of its 2021 survey of drivers 
of trust in government institutions for 
acknowledgement and discussion).

complacent inappropriate ways increasing risks organizations individuals raising quality issues example almost half admit using ways contravene organizational policies uploading sensitive company information such financial sales customer information public tools three five report they have seen heard other employees using tools inappropriate ways two three report relying output without evaluating information provides over half say they have made mistakes their work due what makes these risks even more challenging manage over half employees avoid revealing when they use complete their work present generated content their own these findings highlight lack transparency accountability way particularly generative tools being used employees work complacent use may fueled inadequate training guidance governance responsible use work within organizations use only one two employees advanced economies report their organization offers training responsible has policies practices responsible use strategy culture supports despite high use generative tools only two five say there policy guiding its use complacent use may also exacerbated sense pressure use half employees feeling they will left behind they don governance perspective these findings highlight critical gap urgent need organizations proactively invest responsible training literacy employees

say they put less effort into their studies assessment knowing they can rely lack institutional support responsible use may contributing problem only half students report their education provider has policies guide responsible use learning assessment training resources support understanding responsible use these findings may have longer term implications effective development essential skills such critical thinking communication collaboration implications organizations these students enter workforce trust cannot taken granted many people wary about trusting systems particularly advanced economies despite high rates individual adoption trust remains critical challenge over half people wary about trusting systems underlying average differences between economic groups three five people advanced economies unwilling unsure about trusting systems contrast emerging economies three five people trust systems find similar levels employee trust use work student trust educational purposes people more skeptical about safety security ethical use systems more trusting technical ability provide helpful output services helps explain individual use gain performance benefits despite trust

Key amendments/ relaxations: 
The Amendments issued by SEBI have introduced certain new requirements and given certain relaxations to HVLDEs

1.
Relaxation in the threshold for identification of HVDLEs
The threshold of listed outstanding non-convertible securities for identification of a debt listed entity as HVDLE 
has been increased from INR500 crore to INR1,000 crore and above. The HVDLEs would be determined on 
basis of value of principal outstanding of listed debt securities as at 31 March 2025. 
2.

Applicability
Regulation 3(3) of the LODR Regulations 
stipulate that the corporate governance norms

Further, it does not define the duration for 
which a HVDLE should continue to comply 
with such provisions, once the outstanding 
debt securities falls below INR500 crore.
Existing provision

Relaxation with regard to constitution of the Nomination and remuneration committee 
(NRC), Risk Management Committee (RMC) and Stakeholders Relationship Committee 
(SRC)
4.
Requirements related to maximum number of directorships
The existing Regulation 17A of LODR Regulations specifies the count for the number of listed entities on which a 
person is allowed be a director / independent director. These existing regulations exclude HVDLEs while 
counting the number of directorships held by a person. 
5.
Requirements related to number of memberships or chairpersonships in the 
committees by a director
The existing provisions of the LODR Regulations set a limit on the number of committees a director can serve as 
a member or a chairperson across all listed entities. However, while determining the number of such listed 
entities, HVDLEs are excluded. 
Regulations 19, 20 and 21 of the LODR Regulations 
requires constitution of NRC, SRC and RMC by 
HVDLEs.
Existing provision
In order to avoid constitution of multiple committees by 
HVDLEs, the Amendments provide certain flexibility to 
HVDLEs under Chapter VA where the Board of 
Directors may choose that the functions of the NRC and 
SRC may be discharged by the Board of Directors and 
a separate NRC or SRC may not be constituted. 
Similarly, the functions of the RMC may be discharged 
by audit committee or by the Board of Directors 
instead of constituting a separate RMC.
Amendment
Regulation 17A of LODR Regulations, inter-alia, 
specifies maximum number of directorships, 
including any alternate directorships that a person 
can hold at any point of time as:
•
A person shall not be a director or an 
independent director in more than seven listed 
entities and 
•
any person who is serving as a whole time 
director / managing director in any listed entity 
shall not serve as an independent director in 
more than three listed entities.
Existing provision
Chapter VA states that the number of listed entities on 
which a person is a director / independent director shall 
be cumulative of those whose equity shares are listed 
on a stock exchange and HVDLEs.
Amendment
As per Regulation 26, a director can be a member of 
up to 10 committees and chairperson of up to 5 
committees across all listed entities. This limit 
includes all public limited companies, whether listed 
or not, but excludes private limited companies, 
foreign companies, HVDLEs, and companies under 
Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. Only the 
chairpersonship and membership of the audit 
committee and the stakeholders' relationship 
committee are considered for this limit.
Existing provision
To ensure that directors devote adequate time to listed 
entities including HVDLEs and in the interest of 
investor protection, post amendment in the LODR 
regulation, HVDLEs (along with equity listed 
companies) shall be considered for the purpose of 
computing the maximum limit of committees, a director 
can act as a member or a chairperson.

Requirements pertaining to Related Party transactions (RPT)
Regulation 23 of LODR Regulations specifies the regulatory requirements pertaining to RPTs inter-alia including 
formulation of a policy on materiality of RPTs and on dealing with RPTs, prior approval of audit committee for all 
RPTs, and prior approval of shareholders through resolution for material RPTs.
It was observed that in certain debt-listed entities, shareholding is often concentrated among a few related 
parties. When these entities engage in RPTs, they must obtain approval from the majority of non-related party 
shareholders. However, these non-related party shareholders often hold negligible or no equity, making 
compliance with LODR Regulations difficult.
It was also noted that when companies borrow from banks, banks include covenants in lending agreements 
requiring prior approval for RPTs to manage conflicts of interest and ensure financial health by preventing 
entering into RPTs outside the ordinary course of business or not at an arm’s length, incurring financial 
indebtedness without lender approval, etc. A similar approach was felt to be adopted to protect debenture holders 
from unfair treatment and ensure the entity's repayment capability. 
Accordingly, Chapter VA introduced certain key requirements in relation to RPTs entered by HVDLEs or its 
subsidiary:
o
HVDLEs must formulate a policy on the materiality of RPTs and on dealing with RPTs, including clear 
threshold limits. This policy must be approved by the board of directors and reviewed at least once every 
three years.
o
RPTs exceeding the below mentioned threshold would be deemed to be material transactions -

lower of INR1,000 crore or 10 per cent of the annual consolidated turnover of the HVDLE and

RPTs more than 5 per cent of the annual consolidated turnover for payments for brand usage or 
royalty. 
o
All RPTs and subsequent material modifications require prior approval from the audit committee.
o
The audit committee may grant omnibus approval for repetitive RPTs, subject to specific conditions, 
including quarterly reviews.
o
Material RPTs and subsequent material modifications require a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the 
Debenture Trustee, who must obtain approval from debenture holders holding more than 50 per cent of the 
debentures in value related to listed debt securities issued on or after 1 April 2025. Such NOC is not 
required, in case of outstanding listed debt securities as on 31 March 2025, for existing or prospective 
material related party transactions.
o
After obtaining approval from debenture holders, shareholders’ approval through a resolution is required. If 
the NOC has been withheld, then the matter shall not be taken forward for shareholders’ consideration.
o
Certain transactions are exempt from these requirements, including transactions between two government 
companies; transactions between the listed holding company and its wholly-owned subsidiary or 
transactions between two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the listed holding company whose accounts are 
consolidated with such holding company

First Notes – 5 May 2025
Threshold increase and sunset clause
The Amendments have raised the threshold for classifying an entity as an HVDLE from INR500 crore to INR1,000 
crore thereby bringing regulatory focus on those entities with higher level of debt obligations.
Further, the introduction of a sunset clause for HVDLEs if their outstanding debt remains below relevant threshold for 
three consecutive years, provides flexibility for such entities by giving them exemption from certain governance 
obligations. This will help reduce the compliance burden on entities that no longer meet the high-value debt criteria.
Improved investor confidence 
Until 31 March 2025, HVDLEs were allowed to follow the corporate governance requirements on a comply or explain 
basis. The amendments introduce stricter corporate governance norms, ensuring that HVDLEs maintain high 
standards of transparency and accountability. While certain smaller entities may face operational challenges due to 
lack of resources to comply with the new requirements promptly, on an overall basis, these amendments are likely to 
boost investor confidence in the debt market. 
Approvals in relation to RPTs
The Amendments require HVDLEs to formulate a policy for RPTs, specified requirements in relation to approvals for 
material RPTs including subsequent modifications and introduced the requirement to secure NOC from debenture 
trustees for material RPTs. Debenture trustees act as representatives of debenture holders, safeguarding their 
interests. The process of obtaining NOCs promotes transparency and accountability within HVDLEs as well as protect 
debenture holders, ultimately contributing to the stability and attractiveness of the debt market.
Before the Amendments, HVDLEs were required to comply with Regulation 23 in relation to RPTs. While chapter VA 
has now specified the requirement for RPTs for HVDLEs, certain amendments made to Regulation 23 such as 
ratification of certain RPTs by the members of the audit committee, subject to the certain conditions and timelines; 
inclusion of subsidiary companies of listed entities in the ambit of omnibus approval provisions for HVDLE; exemption 
from approval of RPTs related to remuneration and sitting fees paid to Directors, KMPs and senior management who 
are not promoter etc. are not included in Chapter VA. HVDLEs will have to wait for clarity in relation to such 
transactions from SEBI.
Application of Industry standards on RPTs
The HVDLEs would also need to comply with the Industry Standards on Minimum information to be provided for 
review of the Audit Committee and shareholders for approval of an RPT (RPT Industry Standards) which will be 
applicable effective 1 July 2025. 
The RPT Industry Standards provide guidelines for companies in relation to minimum information to be submitted for 
approvals from the Audit Committee and shareholders, where applicable. While the RPT Industry Standards offer a 
consistent framework on compiling information to be provided to the Audit Committee and shareholders, HVDLEs 
which were required to comply with LODR Regulations on a comply or explain basis till 31 March 2025, may encounter 
unique challenges while compiling these disclosures, which would vary based on the maturity of their current 
practices, nature of their transactions and complexity in their ownership structure. Management of the HVDLEs 
companies will also need to plan more effectively and in advance to compile certifications from the CEO, CFO, or 
other key management personnel, as well as from each promoter director, to obtain approvals from Audit Committee 
and shareholders for the RPTs. 
Directors’ and officers’ insurance 
All HVDLEs are required to undertake a Directors and Officers insurance for all its independent directors for such sum 
assured and such risks, as may be determined by the Board of Directors.

First Notes – 5 May 2025
Independent directors
With the inclusion of HVDLEs in the count of maximum directorships and memberships held in various committees, 
the Amendments now bring in rigorous requirements for composition of board various committees, virtually bringing 
HVDLEs at par with compliances required for equity listed companies. Thus, these measures help in protecting the 
interests of debenture holders and fostering investor confidence.
Further, independent directors would need to re-visit on the number of their directorships and memberships held in 
various committees and communicate with the listed entities and HVDLEs any changes in the positions occupied. The 
provisions of this regulation would need to be complied with within six months from the date of the publication of 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 
2025 in the Official Gazette or the date of Annual General Meeting, whichever is later.
Bottomline
The Amendments introduced by SEBI mark a significant step towards enhancing the regulatory framework for 
HVDLEs, while also balancing it with some measures to bring ease in doing business. By introducing corporate 
governance norms, increasing transparency, and ensuring robust compliance, SEBI aims to protect the interests of 
debenture holders and foster investor confidence.

Key amendments/ relaxations: 
The Amendments issued by SEBI have introduced certain new requirements and given certain relaxations to HVLDEs

1.
Relaxation in the threshold for identification of HVDLEs
The threshold of listed outstanding non-convertible securities for identification of a debt listed entity as HVDLE 
has been increased from INR500 crore to INR1,000 crore and above. The HVDLEs would be determined on 
basis of value of principal outstanding of listed debt securities as at 31 March 2025.

with such provisions, once the outstanding 
debt securities falls below INR500 crore.

(NRC), Risk Management Committee (RMC) and Stakeholders Relationship Committee 
(SRC)
4.
Requirements related to maximum number of directorships
The existing Regulation 17A of LODR Regulations specifies the count for the number of listed entities on which a 
person is allowed be a director / independent director. These existing regulations exclude HVDLEs while 
counting the number of directorships held by a person. 
5.
Requirements related to number of memberships or chairpersonships in the 
committees by a director
The existing provisions of the LODR Regulations set a limit on the number of committees a director can serve as 
a member or a chairperson across all listed entities. However, while determining the number of such listed 
entities, HVDLEs are excluded. 
Regulations 19, 20 and 21 of the LODR Regulations 
requires constitution of NRC, SRC and RMC by 
HVDLEs.
Existing provision
In order to avoid constitution of multiple committees by 
HVDLEs, the Amendments provide certain flexibility to 
HVDLEs under Chapter VA where the Board of 
Directors may choose that the functions of the NRC and 
SRC may be discharged by the Board of Directors and 
a separate NRC or SRC may not be constituted. 
Similarly, the functions of the RMC may be discharged 
by audit committee or by the Board of Directors 
instead of constituting a separate RMC.
Amendment
Regulation 17A of LODR Regulations, inter-alia, 
specifies maximum number of directorships, 
including any alternate directorships that a person 
can hold at any point of time as:
•
A person shall not be a director or an 
independent director in more than seven listed 
entities and 
•
any person who is serving as a whole time 
director / managing director in any listed entity 
shall not serve as an independent director in 
more than three listed entities.
Existing provision
Chapter VA states that the number of listed entities on 
which a person is a director / independent director shall 
be cumulative of those whose equity shares are listed 
on a stock exchange and HVDLEs.
Amendment
As per Regulation 26, a director can be a member of 
up to 10 committees and chairperson of up to 5 
committees across all listed entities. This limit 
includes all public limited companies, whether listed 
or not, but excludes private limited companies, 
foreign companies, HVDLEs, and companies under 
Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. Only the 
chairpersonship and membership of the audit 
committee and the stakeholders' relationship 
committee are considered for this limit.
Existing provision
To ensure that directors devote adequate time to listed 
entities including HVDLEs and in the interest of 
investor protection, post amendment in the LODR 
regulation, HVDLEs (along with equity listed 
companies) shall be considered for the purpose of 
computing the maximum limit of committees, a director 
can act as a member or a chairperson.

Requirements pertaining to Related Party transactions (RPT)
Regulation 23 of LODR Regulations specifies the regulatory requirements pertaining to RPTs inter-alia including 
formulation of a policy on materiality of RPTs and on dealing with RPTs, prior approval of audit committee for all 
RPTs, and prior approval of shareholders through resolution for material RPTs.
It was observed that in certain debt-listed entities, shareholding is often concentrated among a few related 
parties. When these entities engage in RPTs, they must obtain approval from the majority of non-related party 
shareholders. However, these non-related party shareholders often hold negligible or no equity, making 
compliance with LODR Regulations difficult.
It was also noted that when companies borrow from banks, banks include covenants in lending agreements 
requiring prior approval for RPTs to manage conflicts of interest and ensure financial health by preventing 
entering into RPTs outside the ordinary course of business or not at an arm’s length, incurring financial 
indebtedness without lender approval, etc. A similar approach was felt to be adopted to protect debenture holders 
from unfair treatment and ensure the entity's repayment capability. 
Accordingly, Chapter VA introduced certain key requirements in relation to RPTs entered by HVDLEs or its 
subsidiary:
o
HVDLEs must formulate a policy on the materiality of RPTs and on dealing with RPTs, including clear 
threshold limits. This policy must be approved by the board of directors and reviewed at least once every 
three years.
o
RPTs exceeding the below mentioned threshold would be deemed to be material transactions -

lower of INR1,000 crore or 10 per cent of the annual consolidated turnover of the HVDLE and

RPTs more than 5 per cent of the annual consolidated turnover for payments for brand usage or 
royalty. 
o
All RPTs and subsequent material modifications require prior approval from the audit committee.
o
The audit committee may grant omnibus approval for repetitive RPTs, subject to specific conditions, 
including quarterly reviews.
o
Material RPTs and subsequent material modifications require a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the 
Debenture Trustee, who must obtain approval from debenture holders holding more than 50 per cent of the 
debentures in value related to listed debt securities issued on or after 1 April 2025. Such NOC is not 
required, in case of outstanding listed debt securities as on 31 March 2025, for existing or prospective 
material related party transactions.
o
After obtaining approval from debenture holders, shareholders’ approval through a resolution is required. If 
the NOC has been withheld, then the matter shall not be taken forward for shareholders’ consideration.
o
Certain transactions are exempt from these requirements, including transactions between two government 
companies; transactions between the listed holding company and its wholly-owned subsidiary or 
transactions between two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the listed holding company whose accounts are 
consolidated with such holding company

Introduction of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for HVDLEs 
on a voluntary basis
Regulation 34(2)(f) of LODR Regulations mandates top 1,000 listed companies (by market capitalisation) to 
provide disclosures as per the BRSR. 
To inculcate practice of good governance at par with equity listed, HVDLEs may comply with the requirements of 
publishing BRSR on a voluntary basis by providing in its annual report, a Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report on the environmental, social and governance disclosures. HVDLEs may provide the BRSR 
report as per the existing Regulation 34(2)(f) of LODR Regulations.
Other key aspects covered in Chapter VA to be complied by HVDLEs
Key amendments/ relaxations (Contd.)

First Notes – 5 May 2025
Threshold increase and sunset clause
The Amendments have raised the threshold for classifying an entity as an HVDLE from INR500 crore to INR1,000 
crore thereby bringing regulatory focus on those entities with higher level of debt obligations.
Further, the introduction of a sunset clause for HVDLEs if their outstanding debt remains below relevant threshold for 
three consecutive years, provides flexibility for such entities by giving them exemption from certain governance 
obligations. This will help reduce the compliance burden on entities that no longer meet the high-value debt criteria.
Improved investor confidence 
Until 31 March 2025, HVDLEs were allowed to follow the corporate governance requirements on a comply or explain 
basis. The amendments introduce stricter corporate governance norms, ensuring that HVDLEs maintain high 
standards of transparency and accountability. While certain smaller entities may face operational challenges due to 
lack of resources to comply with the new requirements promptly, on an overall basis, these amendments are likely to 
boost investor confidence in the debt market. 
Approvals in relation to RPTs
The Amendments require HVDLEs to formulate a policy for RPTs, specified requirements in relation to approvals for 
material RPTs including subsequent modifications and introduced the requirement to secure NOC from debenture 
trustees for material RPTs. Debenture trustees act as representatives of debenture holders, safeguarding their 
interests. The process of obtaining NOCs promotes transparency and accountability within HVDLEs as well as protect 
debenture holders, ultimately contributing to the stability and attractiveness of the debt market.
Before the Amendments, HVDLEs were required to comply with Regulation 23 in relation to RPTs. While chapter VA 
has now specified the requirement for RPTs for HVDLEs, certain amendments made to Regulation 23 such as 
ratification of certain RPTs by the members of the audit committee, subject to the certain conditions and timelines; 
inclusion of subsidiary companies of listed entities in the ambit of omnibus approval provisions for HVDLE; exemption 
from approval of RPTs related to remuneration and sitting fees paid to Directors, KMPs and senior management who 
are not promoter etc. are not included in Chapter VA. HVDLEs will have to wait for clarity in relation to such 
transactions from SEBI.
Application of Industry standards on RPTs
The HVDLEs would also need to comply with the Industry Standards on Minimum information to be provided for 
review of the Audit Committee and shareholders for approval of an RPT (RPT Industry Standards) which will be 
applicable effective 1 July 2025. 
The RPT Industry Standards provide guidelines for companies in relation to minimum information to be submitted for 
approvals from the Audit Committee and shareholders, where applicable. While the RPT Industry Standards offer a 
consistent framework on compiling information to be provided to the Audit Committee and shareholders, HVDLEs 
which were required to comply with LODR Regulations on a comply or explain basis till 31 March 2025, may encounter 
unique challenges while compiling these disclosures, which would vary based on the maturity of their current 
practices, nature of their transactions and complexity in their ownership structure. Management of the HVDLEs 
companies will also need to plan more effectively and in advance to compile certifications from the CEO, CFO, or 
other key management personnel, as well as from each promoter director, to obtain approvals from Audit Committee 
and shareholders for the RPTs. 
Directors’ and officers’ insurance 
All HVDLEs are required to undertake a Directors and Officers insurance for all its independent directors for such sum 
assured and such risks, as may be determined by the Board of Directors.

First Notes – 5 May 2025
Independent directors
With the inclusion of HVDLEs in the count of maximum directorships and memberships held in various committees, 
the Amendments now bring in rigorous requirements for composition of board various committees, virtually bringing 
HVDLEs at par with compliances required for equity listed companies. Thus, these measures help in protecting the 
interests of debenture holders and fostering investor confidence.
Further, independent directors would need to re-visit on the number of their directorships and memberships held in 
various committees and communicate with the listed entities and HVDLEs any changes in the positions occupied. The 
provisions of this regulation would need to be complied with within six months from the date of the publication of 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 
2025 in the Official Gazette or the date of Annual General Meeting, whichever is later.
Bottomline
The Amendments introduced by SEBI mark a significant step towards enhancing the regulatory framework for 
HVDLEs, while also balancing it with some measures to bring ease in doing business. By introducing corporate 
governance norms, increasing transparency, and ensuring robust compliance, SEBI aims to protect the interests of 
debenture holders and foster investor confidence.

Customer retention is dependent on their satisfaction with the brand and their tendency to explore alternatives. ‘Ambassadors’ are highly satisfied customers who will keep contributing to the brand’s success. ‘Switchers’ on the other hand, are always seeking better options. ‘Critics’ as the third segment, actively convey negative feedback about the brand, if not satisfied. Finally, ‘Dependents’ are customers who remain loyal despite low satisfaction due to lack of alternatives in the market.
63 per cent of the customer base are ambassadors as their brand of choice meets their expectations on
Despite strong performance of prioritized experience attributes, 35 per cent of the consumers are likely to substitute their preferred brand if it fails to meet their expectations on
Key attribute driving both ambassadors and switchers is ‘Availability of offerings’
(Weightage of the pillars to the overall experience requirements)
Expectation (20 per cent) and Integrity (15 per cent) are the key pillars of experience while making a purchase decision
Within expectation, the top attribute driving decisions is

An individual’s willingness to pay a premium is driven by immediate needs. As the today’s customer evolves, the focal aspects of premiumisation has shifted from functionality to experience. These aspect may as well translate as personalized convenience, omnichannel browsing or even exclusivity in customer support.

Accelerating with intent: Why consumer and 
retail must level  up on data
In an era of rapid technological advancements, 
consumer and retail companies are amassing 
vast amounts of data. However, the challenge 
lies in transforming this data into actionable 
insights. While there is a consensus that 
data is pivotal for driving performance and 
competitiveness, many businesses struggle 
to convert it into meaningful outcomes. They 
find themselves inundated with information, 
yet lacking the critical insights necessary for 
sustainable growth and innovation.”
Isabelle Allen 
Global Head of Consumer & Retail, KPMG International
Consumer and retail (C&R) companies are embracing digital transformation with a renewed sense of direction. 
To move forward at speed, they must ramp up investment in their data capabilities.  
Today’s challenging economic climate is forcing consumers and 
organizations to adapt. According to KPMG’s recent global Consumer 
& Retail CEO Outlook, 81 percent of industry execs expect the cost 
of living crisis to negatively impact their organization for the next three 
years.1 To succeed, consumer and retail companies must anticipate and 
adapt to consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. Technology can 
help them achieve that. By harnessing the power of data, businesses 
can gain a deeper understanding of their customers, optimize their 
operations, and deliver personalized and seamless experiences that 
drive loyalty and growth.   
But, the reality is, many C&R companies fall short with these data 
ambitions. As noted in KPMG’s report: From data overload to data-
driven decisions in retail, “Many retailers are not able to [create] the 
unified data and insights [they require], due to inadequate infrastructure, 
siloed data and departments, multiple but disparate technology 
systems, and out-of-sync transformations.”2
Against this backdrop, the KPMG Global Tech Report 2024, based 
on a survey of 2,450 executives from 26 countries across eight 
sectors, explores how C&R businesses are using technology to 
create value at a time of significant volatility, and how they are 
overcoming challenges such as poor data quality, siloed data and 
capability gaps.
Our research, which features insights from 490 executives from C&R 
businesses, suggests the sector is pursuing a targeted technology 
investment strategy. More sophisticated data capabilities and  
scaling-up artificial intelligence (AI) use cases with trust and security 
in mind can help leading businesses secure competitive advantage.

The highly intentional digital transformation  
strategies of C&R businesses can deliver 
superior results
Rather than defaulting to copy their competitors’ tech investment choices, as 
seen in the 2023 research, C&R companies are shifting to a more targeted 
approach. They are focusing their tech spending on the areas with the greatest 
potential to drive returns. And this focused approach is paying off.
For every technology type in our research, the proportion of C&R companies 
reporting greater profitability because of their investments has increased 
year-on-year. Moreover, these businesses are more likely to see larger profit 
increases (10 percent or more) in comparison with the cross-sector average. 
Figure 1: Year-on-year increase in proportion of C&R technology executives confirming digital transformation

The highly intentional digital 
transformation strategies of C&R...
In today’s price-conscious climate for consumers and businesses, 
data is unlocking greater profitability for the industry. As seen in 
the KPMG research ‘From data overload to data-driven decisions in 
retail’,3 dynamic data-driven pricing tools that adapt prices to market 
forces, competitor moves and customer behavior patterns, are helping 
retail and consumer companies enhance their profits.
A KPMG report, ‘The Australian Retail Outlook,’ highlights the critical 
need for retailers to embrace advanced technologies to compete 
effectively. “The future of retail success lies in creating seamless, 
personalized, and engaging experiences that resonate with customers 
on an emotional level. This means leveraging data analytics to 
personalize the shopping experience and integrating backend systems to 
help achieve real-time visibility across touchpoints. By embracing these 
technologies, Australian retailers can capture a share of the growing 
e-commerce market and build lasting customer loyalty.” James Stewart, 
National Sector Leader for Consumer and Retail, KPMG Australia
Barry Raghunathan, Consumer & Retail Technology Leader at KPMG 
in [country], notes that the most productive change journeys in the

Early adopters are yielding significant benefits,” confirms Martin Sokalski, US Consulting Technology

areas such as store support and inventory management. Data analytics tools are enabling them to identify 
their most profitable products and to get those in front of customers.” 
that is underpinned by driving strategic business value, as opposed 
to seeking technology optimization alone. “The strategist lens goes 
beyond technological factors of a certain project in silo and adjusts to 
optimize the long-term impacts on, say, the employee experience and 
the strategic goals of the enterprise,” Raghunathan says. 
The 2024 KPMG Global Tech Report data indicates that this strategist 
ethos is beginning to shape the sector’s spending habits. In contrast 
with 2023, instead of merely imitating their competitors’ investment 
patterns, C&R companies are now laser-focused on what works best 
for them. Consequently, following competitors is no longer the top 
driver of tech investment decisions. In this latest research, 74 percent 
say their priorities for technology investments reflect proven returns 
on previous investment, up from 50 percent in 2023. The number 
of companies investing based on the results of trials and proof-of-
concept (PoC) testing has also increased markedly.
This disciplined and methodical investment approach is set to 
continue. While most C&R respondents plan to invest further in the 
tech categories measured, this is at a slightly lower rate than the  
cross-sector average, indicating considered restraint.

Targeted improvements are enhancing 
data maturity    
Over the past year, the proportion of C&R 
companies in our study reaching the most 
advanced stages of maturity for their data-
management activities has increased 
significantly, with 52 percent of these businesses 
describing their ability to extract meaningful 
insight from data as ‘influential’ or ‘embedded,’ 
up from 38 percent in 2023. And 50 percent 
say the same about data accessibility, a 
17-percentage-point increase on a year ago.

Targeted improvements are 
enhancing data maturity    
Nevertheless, maturity in this sector lags the levels recorded in 
other sectors. According to Raghunathan, Consumer Packaged 
Goods (CPG) companies should strive to improve their first-
party data efforts and how that data informs their workflows. 
And regarding third-party data strategies: “We’re seeing a lot 
of inefficiency, a lot of missed opportunities,” says Sokalski. 
“Thankfully, many in the sector are crafting a single view of the 
customer across different channels.”
While acquiring third-party data has long been the priority,  
many fail to utilize the data to its full potential for more targeted 
marketing — personalized recommendations, or improved supply 
chain management. Raghunathan cites the example of a leading 
CPG business that spends millions of dollars each year on third-
party data from a retail partner but uses less than one-tenth of 
the data collected. As well as being more selective as to which 
third-party datasets they purchase, organizations should put 
those sources to work by using the insights to enhance their 
operations. For instance, learnings about customer appetites 
can help enhance product design and inventory management 
to minimize wastage, and insights on unit locations can bring 
new supply chain efficiencies to accelerate production and 
distribution. 
One data management area of particular focus is the imperative 
to plug leaks in voice-of-the-customer data strategies. Indeed, 
60 percent of C&R respondents say that they collect customer 
feedback but frequently fail to use the insights. Stubborn data 
disconnects between contact channels obstruct the transfer of 
customer insights across C&R businesses. These disconnects 
also limit the functionality of the omnichannel capabilities C&R 
companies have been investing into over the past decade. Despite 
years of work unifying data and silos into a centralized source,  
many companies are still yet to establish a true ‘single source of 
truth’ for their customer data, says Raghunathan. 
So, rather than having seamless omnichannel interactions between 
a provider’s e-commerce platform, physical stores and marketing 
campaigns, for example, often consumers must endure fragmented 
shopping experiences because various pieces of data remain 
trapped within different channels. To help resolve this, the sector 
needs to persevere with prioritizing its first-party data strategies 
and addressing the data siloes and legacy systems that underpin its 
various delivery platforms. 
Strengthening data foundations would also help C&R businesses to 
become more agile and adaptive. Many point to scenario-forecasting 
and risk-identification workshops as especially important to their ability 
to respond to evolving market trends and emerging risks.

AI is generating widespread

C&R businesses are implementing AI with some urgency:  
73 percent report already having achieved business value 
from such initiatives. That mirrors the findings of our recent 
research on retail in the Asia-Pacific region, where nearly 
every company surveyed is exploring or implementing AI. 
Several executives noted that the rate of uptake is surpassing 
any previous technology.4 Similarly, our latest Consumer & 
Retail CEO Outlook research found leaders in the sector now 
see the race to embrace and embed generative AI (Gen AI) 
as their third-biggest challenge; only economic uncertainty 
and geopolitical complexity are more top-of-mind.5 
Respondents to this research point to a wide range of 
examples, including opportunities for operational efficiencies 
and the potential to drive revenue growth through new 
product development.

plan to shift to a centralized approach to AI 
experimentation once they have obtained a 
critical mass of ideas from the workforce.
C&R businesses encourage cross-functional collaboration to drive 
the discovery of new AI use cases. Indeed, 46 percent of these 
businesses say open collaboration is their preferred approach, 
with AI centers of excellence or other working groups that include 
colleagues from across their organizations. 
As they scale AI implementation, C&R companies are conscious 
of the imperative to maintain good governance, with trust and 
cybersecurity key considerations. KPMG’s C&R CEO Outlook6   
found leaders preparing carefully to govern their own use of AI and 
automation. In that research, many C&R CEOs (84 percent — which 
is higher than all other sectors surveyed) agreed that the degree of 
regulation for Gen AI should mirror that of climate commitments.
This governance imperative will likely see new control structures 
emerge. Currently, 39 percent plan to shift to a centralized approach 
to AI experimentation once they have obtained a critical mass of 
ideas from the workforce. 
“The number of use cases is growing exponentially,” says 
Raghunathan. “C&R companies need to prioritize, but it also forces 
them to focus on governance. As these use cases come to life, it’s 
clear some of the models do include problematic biases.”

Consumer and retail companies are rapidly

becomes a key investment area, organizations 
must prioritize a holistic strategy that aligns 
with immediate business goals and delivers

Accelerating with intent: Why consumer and 
retail must level  up on data
In an era of rapid technological advancements, 
consumer and retail companies are amassing 
vast amounts of data. However, the challenge 
lies in transforming this data into actionable 
insights. While there is a consensus that 
data is pivotal for driving performance and 
competitiveness, many businesses struggle 
to convert it into meaningful outcomes. They 
find themselves inundated with information, 
yet lacking the critical insights necessary for 
sustainable growth and innovation.”
Isabelle Allen 
Global Head of Consumer & Retail, KPMG International
Consumer and retail (C&R) companies are embracing digital transformation with a renewed sense of direction. 
To move forward at speed, they must ramp up investment in their data capabilities.  
Today’s challenging economic climate is forcing consumers and 
organizations to adapt. According to KPMG’s recent global Consumer 
& Retail CEO Outlook, 81 percent of industry execs expect the cost 
of living crisis to negatively impact their organization for the next three 
years.1 To succeed, consumer and retail companies must anticipate and 
adapt to consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. Technology can 
help them achieve that. By harnessing the power of data, businesses 
can gain a deeper understanding of their customers, optimize their 
operations, and deliver personalized and seamless experiences that 
drive loyalty and growth.   
But, the reality is, many C&R companies fall short with these data 
ambitions. As noted in KPMG’s report: From data overload to data-
driven decisions in retail, “Many retailers are not able to [create] the 
unified data and insights [they require], due to inadequate infrastructure, 
siloed data and departments, multiple but disparate technology 
systems, and out-of-sync transformations.”2
Against this backdrop, the KPMG Global Tech Report 2024, based 
on a survey of 2,450 executives from 26 countries across eight 
sectors, explores how C&R businesses are using technology to 
create value at a time of significant volatility, and how they are 
overcoming challenges such as poor data quality, siloed data and 
capability gaps.
Our research, which features insights from 490 executives from C&R 
businesses, suggests the sector is pursuing a targeted technology 
investment strategy. More sophisticated data capabilities and  
scaling-up artificial intelligence (AI) use cases with trust and security 
in mind can help leading businesses secure competitive advantage.

The highly intentional digital transformation  
strategies of C&R businesses can deliver 
superior results
Rather than defaulting to copy their competitors’ tech investment choices, as 
seen in the 2023 research, C&R companies are shifting to a more targeted 
approach. They are focusing their tech spending on the areas with the greatest 
potential to drive returns. And this focused approach is paying off.
For every technology type in our research, the proportion of C&R companies 
reporting greater profitability because of their investments has increased 
year-on-year. Moreover, these businesses are more likely to see larger profit 
increases (10 percent or more) in comparison with the cross-sector average.

The highly intentional digital 
transformation strategies of C&R...
In today’s price-conscious climate for consumers and businesses, 
data is unlocking greater profitability for the industry. As seen in 
the KPMG research ‘From data overload to data-driven decisions in 
retail’,3 dynamic data-driven pricing tools that adapt prices to market 
forces, competitor moves and customer behavior patterns, are helping 
retail and consumer companies enhance their profits.
A KPMG report, ‘The Australian Retail Outlook,’ highlights the critical 
need for retailers to embrace advanced technologies to compete 
effectively. “The future of retail success lies in creating seamless, 
personalized, and engaging experiences that resonate with customers 
on an emotional level. This means leveraging data analytics to 
personalize the shopping experience and integrating backend systems to 
help achieve real-time visibility across touchpoints. By embracing these 
technologies, Australian retailers can capture a share of the growing 
e-commerce market and build lasting customer loyalty.” James Stewart, 
National Sector Leader for Consumer and Retail, KPMG Australia
Barry Raghunathan, Consumer & Retail Technology Leader at KPMG 
in [country], notes that the most productive change journeys in the 
sector are led by CIOs who prioritize a holistic technology strategy 
Early adopters are yielding significant benefits,” confirms Martin Sokalski, US Consulting Technology 
Leader for Consumer and Retail KPMG in [country]. “AI-powered solutions are delivering quick returns in 
areas such as store support and inventory management. Data analytics tools are enabling them to identify 
their most profitable products and to get those in front of customers.” 
that is underpinned by driving strategic business value, as opposed 
to seeking technology optimization alone. “The strategist lens goes 
beyond technological factors of a certain project in silo and adjusts to 
optimize the long-term impacts on, say, the employee experience and 
the strategic goals of the enterprise,” Raghunathan says. 
The 2024 KPMG Global Tech Report data indicates that this strategist 
ethos is beginning to shape the sector’s spending habits. In contrast 
with 2023, instead of merely imitating their competitors’ investment 
patterns, C&R companies are now laser-focused on what works best 
for them. Consequently, following competitors is no longer the top 
driver of tech investment decisions. In this latest research, 74 percent 
say their priorities for technology investments reflect proven returns 
on previous investment, up from 50 percent in 2023. The number 
of companies investing based on the results of trials and proof-of-
concept (PoC) testing has also increased markedly.
This disciplined and methodical investment approach is set to 
continue. While most C&R respondents plan to invest further in the 
tech categories measured, this is at a slightly lower rate than the  
cross-sector average, indicating considered restraint.

Targeted improvements are enhancing 
data maturity    
Over the past year, the proportion of C&R 
companies in our study reaching the most 
advanced stages of maturity for their data-
management activities has increased 
significantly, with 52 percent of these businesses 
describing their ability to extract meaningful 
insight from data as ‘influential’ or ‘embedded,’ 
up from 38 percent in 2023. And 50 percent 
say the same about data accessibility, a 
17-percentage-point increase on a year ago.

Nevertheless, maturity in this sector lags the levels recorded in 
other sectors. According to Raghunathan, Consumer Packaged 
Goods (CPG) companies should strive to improve their first-
party data efforts and how that data informs their workflows. 
And regarding third-party data strategies: “We’re seeing a lot 
of inefficiency, a lot of missed opportunities,” says Sokalski. 
“Thankfully, many in the sector are crafting a single view of the 
customer across different channels.”
While acquiring third-party data has long been the priority,  
many fail to utilize the data to its full potential for more targeted 
marketing — personalized recommendations, or improved supply 
chain management. Raghunathan cites the example of a leading 
CPG business that spends millions of dollars each year on third-
party data from a retail partner but uses less than one-tenth of 
the data collected. As well as being more selective as to which 
third-party datasets they purchase, organizations should put 
those sources to work by using the insights to enhance their 
operations. For instance, learnings about customer appetites 
can help enhance product design and inventory management 
to minimize wastage, and insights on unit locations can bring 
new supply chain efficiencies to accelerate production and 
distribution. 
One data management area of particular focus is the imperative 
to plug leaks in voice-of-the-customer data strategies. Indeed, 
60 percent of C&R respondents say that they collect customer 
feedback but frequently fail to use the insights. Stubborn data 
disconnects between contact channels obstruct the transfer of 
customer insights across C&R businesses. These disconnects 
also limit the functionality of the omnichannel capabilities C&R 
companies have been investing into over the past decade. Despite 
years of work unifying data and silos into a centralized source,  
many companies are still yet to establish a true ‘single source of 
truth’ for their customer data, says Raghunathan. 
So, rather than having seamless omnichannel interactions between 
a provider’s e-commerce platform, physical stores and marketing 
campaigns, for example, often consumers must endure fragmented 
shopping experiences because various pieces of data remain 
trapped within different channels. To help resolve this, the sector 
needs to persevere with prioritizing its first-party data strategies 
and addressing the data siloes and legacy systems that underpin its 
various delivery platforms. 
Strengthening data foundations would also help C&R businesses to 
become more agile and adaptive. Many point to scenario-forecasting 
and risk-identification workshops as especially important to their ability 
to respond to evolving market trends and emerging risks.

AI is generating widespread 
business value
C&R businesses are implementing AI with some urgency:  
73 percent report already having achieved business value 
from such initiatives. That mirrors the findings of our recent 
research on retail in the Asia-Pacific region, where nearly 
every company surveyed is exploring or implementing AI. 
Several executives noted that the rate of uptake is surpassing 
any previous technology.4 Similarly, our latest Consumer & 
Retail CEO Outlook research found leaders in the sector now 
see the race to embrace and embed generative AI (Gen AI) 
as their third-biggest challenge; only economic uncertainty 
and geopolitical complexity are more top-of-mind.5 
Respondents to this research point to a wide range of 
examples, including opportunities for operational efficiencies 
and the potential to drive revenue growth through new 
product development.

Product and service development and innovation

plan to shift to a centralized approach to AI 
experimentation once they have obtained a 
critical mass of ideas from the workforce.
C&R businesses encourage cross-functional collaboration to drive 
the discovery of new AI use cases. Indeed, 46 percent of these 
businesses say open collaboration is their preferred approach, 
with AI centers of excellence or other working groups that include 
colleagues from across their organizations. 
As they scale AI implementation, C&R companies are conscious 
of the imperative to maintain good governance, with trust and 
cybersecurity key considerations. KPMG’s C&R CEO Outlook6   
found leaders preparing carefully to govern their own use of AI and 
automation. In that research, many C&R CEOs (84 percent — which 
is higher than all other sectors surveyed) agreed that the degree of 
regulation for Gen AI should mirror that of climate commitments.
This governance imperative will likely see new control structures 
emerge. Currently, 39 percent plan to shift to a centralized approach 
to AI experimentation once they have obtained a critical mass of 
ideas from the workforce. 
“The number of use cases is growing exponentially,” says 
Raghunathan. “C&R companies need to prioritize, but it also forces 
them to focus on governance. As these use cases come to life, it’s 
clear some of the models do include problematic biases.”

Consumer and retail companies are rapidly 
transforming through digitalization and 
enhanced customer experiences. As Gen AI 
becomes a key investment area, organizations 
must prioritize a holistic strategy that aligns 
with immediate business goals and delivers 
sustainable value. This strategic approach 
should focus on the long-term impact on 
customer experience and overall business 
objectives, helping ensure that investments 
drive meaningful business value beyond 
individual technical projects.”

Editorial
The determination of lease term is a critical area 
requiring careful judgement, particularly in 
assessing enforceable rights, extension options, 
and termination clauses. Ind AS 116, Leases, 
requires lessees to look at the contractual terms in 
conjunction with the broader economic incentives 
and factors influencing lease decisions to 
determine lease term. This edition of Accounting 
and Auditing Update (AAU) includes an article that 
discusses the key factors involved in determining 
the lease term, along with the complexities of 
lease modifications and lease re-assessments 
along with case studies.
In March 2025, the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (SEBI) responded to the evolving 
needs to the issuer companies by introducing the 
SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure 
Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 2025 
(ICDR Amendment Regulations 2025). These 
amendments bring several changes aimed at 
streamlining compliance and enhancing the 
efficiency and transparency of fundraising 
processes. Our article provides an overview of the 
ICDR Amendment Regulations 2025 discussing 
the key amendments such as introduction of 
voluntary proforma financials in Qualified 
Institutions Placement, amendments affecting the 
promoter / promoter group, simplification of rights 
issue process, harmonisation of provisions of SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 and SEBI (Issue of Capital and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018, etc.
There have been various regulatory developments 
in India and internationally during the month. 
The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises (MSMEs) issued a notification 
announcing significant changes to the financial 
thresholds that define MSME classification. 
Additionally, SEBI issued the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
(Amendment) Regulations, 2025 aimed at 
enhancing corporate governance norms and 
compliance for listed entities, mainly in relation to 
High-Value Debt Listed Entities (HVDLEs). 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued certain 
clarifications to the RBI (Financial Statements - 
Presentation and Disclosures) Directions, 2021, in 
relation to presentation and disclosures in the 
financial statements, applicable to all commercial 
and cooperative banks for the financial year ended 
31 March 2025 and onwards. The National 
Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) released 
series 2 and series 3 of the ‘Auditor-Audit 
Committee Interactions Series’ covering audit 
strategy and plan and audit of related parties 
respectively.
Our regulatory updates section covers these and 
other important regulatory developments.
We would be delighted to receive 
feedback/suggestions from you on the topics we 
should cover in the forthcoming editions of AAU.

A lease is a contractual agreement where 
one party (the lessor) grants another party 
(the lessee) the right to use an asset for a 
specified period in exchange for periodic 
payments. Leases are fundamental in various 
sectors, including real estate, equipment 
rental, and vehicle leasing, providing flexibility 
and financial efficiency for businesses and 
individuals alike.
The lease term is a critical aspect of lease 
agreements. It defines the duration for which 
the lessee has the right to use the leased 
asset. Accurately determining the lease term 
is essential because it impacts the financial 
reporting and classification of leases. Ind AS 
116, Leases provides detailed guidance 
for determining the lease term since this is one 
of the key judgement area and can 
significantly affect the amounts recognised in 
the financial statements. Another accounting 
challenge arises when there is a change in 
the lease term during the lease tenure. 
Determining whether this change constitutes 
a modification or a change of estimate is 
crucial for accurate financial reporting to 
reflect the current lease obligations and 
provide transparency to stakeholders.
This article discusses the key aspects 
relevant in determination of lease term 
when accounting for a lease contract.

Lease term
A lease term, as per Ind AS 116, refers to the 
non-cancellable period for which a lessee has 
the right to use an underlying asset. 
This period includes:
• Periods covered by an option to extend the 
lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to 
exercise that option and
• Periods covered by an option to terminate 
the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain 
not to exercise that option.
The below diagram illustrates how the lease 
term may be determined:

option to 
terminate
Option to extend

reasonably certain to 
exercise the option

Lessee is not 
reasonably certain to 
exercise the option
Any option to 
continue the lease 
is not enforceable

• The non-cancellable period under Ind AS 
116 refers to the duration when the lessee 
cannot terminate the lease agreement. 
Consequently, lease term cannot be shorter 
than the non-cancellable period. A lease 
agreement may grant each party the 
unilateral right to terminate the lease, for 
any reason and with no more than an 
insignificant penalty by giving certain notice. 
The non-cancellable period of the lease in 
such cases includes the 'notice' period.
• An enforceable period is the maximum 
length of the lease term.
To determine the enforceable period of the 
lease, an entity applies the definition of a 
contract. An enforceable period under Ind AS 
116 refers to the duration during which the 
lessee and the lessor have enforceable rights 
and obligations. This period is significant in 
determining the lease term, as it includes 
periods where the lease can be enforced by 
either party, even if the lessee has the option 
to extend or terminate the lease. A lease is no 
longer 'enforceable' when both the lessee and 
lessor have the right to terminate it without 
agreement from the other party with no more 
than an insignificant penalty.

To summarise, in determining the lease term, an entity first determines the enforceable period 
and non-cancellable period of the contract.  It then determines where—within the range between 
the non-cancellable period (minimum lease term) and the enforceable period (maximum lease 
term)—the lease term falls.
The key steps to determine the enforceable period are as follows:
Assess the contract broadly – i.e. the combined effects of the following
Determine the enforceable period
Consider the written 
contract terms and 
conditions
Consider the 
relevant laws and 
regulations
Consider penalties and 
termination rights

Some of these principles are illustrated 
through by way of case studies to provide 
practical application of the guidance.
Case Study 1 – Lessee’s option to 
renew lease
Facts:
• Lessee A enters into a lease contract with 
Lessor L to lease a building. 
• The non-cancellable period is 4 years 
• A has the option to extend the lease by 
another 4 years at the same rent
• Market rentals for a comparable building in 
the same area are expected to increase by 
10% over 8 years 
• A intends to stay in business in the same 
area for at least 10 years.
• A has undertaken significant leasehold 
improvements with useful life of 9 years.
Analysis: 
Lessor A should consider the following factors 
to determine the lease term:
• Market rentals for similar properties: At 
the commencement date, rentals under 
the contract reflect the current market 
rates. Further, market rentals for a 
comparable building in the same area 
are expected to increase over the 8 year 
enforceable period
• Strategic reasons: A intends to stay in this 
business in the same area for at least 10 
years. Further, the location of the building 
is ideal for relationships with suppliers and 
customers
• Leasehold improvements: The fact that A 
has undertaken non-removable significant 
leasehold improvements with an estimated 
useful life higher than the enforceable 
period.
Conclusion:
• Lessor A concludes that it has a significant 
economic incentive to extend the lease and 
therefore, is reasonably certain to exercise 
its 4 year extension option. 
• Consequently, A determines that the lease 
term is 8 years.
Key judgements involved when 
a lessee is required to 
determine lease term
Determining the lease term does require 
significant judgement. Some examples of 
judgements involved in determining the lease 
period include:
a. Assessment of economic penalties to be 
considered in assessing the enforceable 
period since an entity applies the definition 
of a contract to determine the enforceable 
period. Enforceability is a matter of law in 
the relevant jurisdiction and each contract 
will need to be evaluated based on its 
terms and conditions;
b. Evaluation of reasonably certainty of 
exercising the termination option. When 
determining the lease term, an entity is 
required to consider all relevant facts and 
circumstances that create an economic 
incentive for the lessee to exercise an 
option to renew or not to exercise an 
option to terminate early. For example – 
• factors such as the significance of 
leasehold improvements 
• importance of the leased asset to the 
lessee’s operations
• past practice regarding the exercise of 
renewal or termination options
• market rentals for similar properties
• strategic reasons for the lessee to 
either stay in the current lease or 
relocate.
The longer the period until the option 
exercise date, the more compelling the 
evidence needs to be that the lessee 
will exercise the option. 
This is due to the 
increasing uncertainty 
of economic conditions 
and incentives as the 
date approaches.

In a different situation, if all the other facts 
of the case remain the same, except that the 
agreement states that the terms and 
conditions for the renewal of 4 additional 
years will be determined and mutually agreed 
at the time of renewal , it would be 
appropriate to conclude that there is no 
enforceable period. This is because there are 
no terms specified in the contract for the 
renewal period and both parties could choose 
to terminate the lease without any significant 
penalties. Accordingly, the lease term in that 
case would be 4 years.
Another common situation that requires 
analysis when there are alterations in lease 
terms – to determine whether it’s a lease 
term reassessment or a lease modification. 
This assessment will impact the accounting 
of lease liability, and the right-of-use asset 
recognised on the balance sheet.

1.
The modification is accounted as a 
separate lease if both conditions are 
satisfied:
•
modification increases the scope of 
lease by adding right to use one or 
more underlying assets and 
•
consideration for the lease increases
by the amount equivalent to the 
standalone price of increase in scope 
and appropriate adjustments to reflect 
contract specific circumstances
The lessee does not revise the discount rate for the 
original lease.
However, the lessee uses a new discount rate to 
account a separate lease. The new rate is determined 
at the effective date of modification. The lessee uses 
the interest rate implicit in the lease if it is readily 
determinable, otherwise the lessee uses its 
incremental borrowing rate. 
Lease modification
A lease modification is defined as a change 
in the scope of a lease, or the consideration 
for a lease, that was not part of the original 
terms and conditions of the lease. Common 
examples are:
• adding or terminating the right to use one 
or more underlying assets
• extending or shortening the contractual 
lease term
• changing the consideration.
Although the lease modification guidance 
is complex, there are essentially two possible 
outcomes:
2. The modification is not 
accounted as a separate lease
The lessee remeasures the lease liability using a revised 
discount rate 
Modifications that decrease the scope of lease: 
Remeasure lease liability by allocating consideration in the 
modified contract, determining the lease term of the modified 
lease and remeasuring lease liability by discounting payments 
using revised discount rate. The revised discount rate is 
determined as:
•
the interest rate implicit in the lease for the remainder of the 
lease term, if can be readily determined, or 
•
the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of 
the modification, if implicit interest rate cannot be readily 
determined.
Adjust carrying value of ROU to reflect partial/ full termination of 
lease and recognise in profit or loss any differential as gain/loss 
pursuant to partial/ full lease termination
Other modifications:
Remeasure lease liability and adjust carrying value of ROU

Lessees must carefully evaluate the 
financial implications of lease modifications, 
considering factors such as the remaining 
lease term, the incremental borrowing rate, 
and any changes in lease payments. 
This process requires a detailed 
understanding of the lease agreement and the 
lessee's business operations, as well as the 
ability to make informed judgements about 
future economic benefits and obligations.
Below case study illustrates the above 
concepts:
Case Study 2
Facts:
• Entity X (lessee) enters into an arrangement 
to lease an office space measuring 2,000 
sq. ft. for a period of 10 years. 
• Entity X makes the annual lease payments 
of INR100,000 per annum 
• The lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at 
the commencement of the lease is 10% p.a.  
• Entity X enters into a lease modification at 
beginning of year 6 whereby the total term 
of the contract is reduced from 10 to 8 
years.  
• The annual lease payments for the space 
measuring 2,000 sq. ft. remains unchanged.
• The lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at 
beginning of year 6 is 11% p.a. 
• The carrying value at the beginning of the 
6th year are as follows: Lease liability - 
INR379,078 and ROU asset - INR307,228
How will Entity X account for the changes in 
the terms of the lease?
Solution: 
• The two conditions to determine whether a 
whether a modification results in a separate 
lease is analysed - 
a. modification increases the scope of 
lease by adding right to use one or more 
underlying assets and 
b. consideration for the lease increases by 
the amount equivalent to the standalone 
price of increase in scope and 
appropriate adjustments to reflect 
contract specific circumstances
• In the given case, since there is only 
decrease in lease term, both the conditions 
are not satisfied
• Thus, the lease modification does not 
amount to a separate lease 
• Step 1: After the modification (at the 
beginning of year 6),  lessee remeasures 
the lease liability with remaining lease term 
of 3 years and incremental borrowing rate of 
11%. The changed lease liability comes to 
INR244,371
• Step 2: Calculate values of ROU and lease 
liability for the remaining term which is 
reduced from 5 to 3 years. 
ROU
Carrying value of ROU 
before modification (A)
307,228
Carrying value of ROU 
after lease modification 
(B)
184,337 
(307,228/5*3) 
Difference in ROU 
adjusted in ROU (A-B)
122,891  
(on account of 
reduction in lease 
term)
Lease Liability
Carrying value of lease 
liability before modification (P)
379,078
New PV calculated (Q)
248,686
(INR100,000 for 3 
years discounted 
@ original interest 
rate 10%)
Difference in lease 
liability (P-Q)
130,392
• Difference in lease liability on account 
of reduction in lease term: 130,392
• Gain on lease modification: Income 
accounted at the beginning of year 6 on 
account of reduction in lease term 
amounts – INR7,501 (130,392- 122,891)
• Effect of revised incremental borrowing 
rate adjusted in ROU asset: The 
incremental borrowing rate increased from 
10% to 11%. The effect of an increase in 
the interest rate from 10% to 11% on the 
lease liability amounts to INR4,315 
(2,48,686 - INR 244,371).

Lease reassessment
Lease modifications are different from lease 
reassessment. After the commencement 
date, lease reassessments take place when 
there are changes in certain contractual 
clauses included in the original contract. 
Common examples of such scenarios are:
• assessment of lease term
• whether a purchase option will be 
exercised
• variable lease payments becoming fixed or 
in-substance fixed payments.
A lessee does not reassess options at every 
reporting date just because market conditions 
change. Instead, they use judgement to spot 
major events or significant changes that 
require reassessment.
In case of lease term reassessment, after the 
commencement date, a lessee reassesses 
whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an 
option to extend the lease or not to exercise 
an option to terminate the lease early. 
The lessee does this when there has been a 
significant event or a significant change in 
circumstances that:   
• is within its control; and
• affects whether it is reasonably certain 
to exercise those options.
Some of the examples of significant events 
and changes in circumstances include:
• significant leasehold improvements that 
the lessee did not anticipate at the 
commencement date, if it expects them 
to have a significant economic benefit 
when the option to extend or terminate 
the lease becomes exercisable
• a significant modification to, or 
customisation of, the underlying asset 
that was not anticipated at the 
commencement date, 
• a business decision of the lessee that 
is directly relevant to exercising, or not 
exercising, an option - e.g. a decision to 
extend the lease of a complementary 
asset etc.
In addition, a lessee revises the lease 
term and remeasures the lease liability when 
there is a change in the non-cancellable 
period of a lease.

Accounting of reassessment of lease term 
is discussed by way of below cash study:
Case Study 3 – Lease reassessment
With the same facts as discussed in case 
study 2, if it was a reassessment of lease term 
from 10 years to 8 years, then the impact is 
only lease liability and ROU the lease liability 
is required to be remeasured at a revised 
discount rate.
Carrying value of lease liability 
at beginning of 6th year (A)
379,078
After the modification (at the 
beginning of year 6), the 
remeasured lease liability at 
the incremental borrowing rate 
of 11% (B)
244,371
(with remaining lease 
term of 3 years)
Difference in lease liability 
(A-B)
134,707
Above difference is debited to lease liability 
and credited to ROU. 
Next steps
Determining the lease term requires significant 
judgement. This is because the lease term 
directly affects the recognition of lease 
liabilities and right-of-use assets on the 
balance sheet, which in turn impacts an 
entity's financial position and performance. 
An entity is expected to consider all relevant 
facts and circumstances that create an 
economic incentive as the lessee, when 
assessing whether it is reasonably certain to 
extend (or not to terminate) a lease – this 
includes significant leasehold improvements 
(taken or planned to be taken) over the term 
of the contract that are expected to have 
significant economic benefit when the option 
to extend (or terminate) becomes exercisable. 
Additionally, an entity considers the 
economics of the contract when determining 
the enforceable period of a lease – e.g. costs 
of abandoning or dismantling leasehold 
improvements, expectations that leasehold 
improvements will be used beyond the date on 
which a contract can be terminated – the 
existence of the leasehold improvements 
indicates that an entity may incur more than 
an insignificant penalty. 
These judgements require a thorough 
understanding of both the lease agreement 
and the lessee's business operations. 
Management must carefully evaluate all 
relevant factors to ensure that the lease term 
estimation aligns with the company's 
economic realities and strategic objectives. 
Appropriate qualitative and quantitative 
disclosures in relation to leases as required by 
Ind AS 116, including due to modifications and 
disclosures in relation to judgements applied 
and estimations done should be included in 
financial statements.  Additionally, it is 
essential to continuously review and update 
these judgements to reflect any significant 
changes in circumstances or new information 
that may affect the lease term. This ongoing 
reassessment helps maintain the accuracy 
and reliability of the financial statements, 
ensuring that they provide a true and fair view 
of the company's lease obligations and 
financial position.

In an effort to ease compliance and reduce 
costs, the Government of India in the Union 
Budget for FY 2023-24 announced that the 
financial sector regulators would conduct a 
comprehensive review of the existing 
regulations, incorporating suggestions from the 
public and regulated entities. In line with this 
objective, on 24 August 2023, an Expert 
Committee was constituted to review the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR 
Regulations) and Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2018 (ICDR 
Regulations). The aim of the Expert 
Committee was to harmonise the provisions of 
these regulations and to promote ease of 
doing business. 
Subsequently, Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (SEBI), through a press release on 
4 October 2023, invited suggestions from 
public and regulated entities on various SEBI 
regulations, including the LODR and ICDR 
Regulations. The Expert Committee then 
presented its recommendations to SEBI 
based on the suggestions and 
recommendations received. 
Consequently, on 3 March 2025, SEBI 
published amendments to ICDR Regulations 
(ICDR Amendment Regulation 2025). 
This article discusses the key aspects of the 
ICDR Amendment Regulations 2025.

Key Amendments
The ICDR Amendment Regulations 2025, 
have inter-alia, introduced or amended the 
following:
1. Voluntarily disclosure of proforma 
financials
Schedule VI – Disclosures in the offer 
document, abridged prospectus and 
abridged letter of offer of the SEBI ICDR 
Regulations required companies to include 
proforma financial statements in their offer 
documents if they had a significant 
acquisition or disposal (20 per cent or more 
of turnover, net worth, or profit/loss) after 
the latest financial period but before filing 
the offer document. Companies could also 
voluntarily include proforma statements 
even if the changes were below this 
threshold. However, the SEBI ICDR 
Regulations did not have an enabling 
regulation to voluntarily include proforma 
financial statements or the disclosure of 
proforma financials for acquisitions or 
divestments in a placement document for a 
qualified institutions placement (QIPs).
The ICDR Amendment Regulations 2025 
allows companies to voluntarily include 
proforma statements for such fiscal periods 
as it deems necessary. These proforma 
financial statements should be prepared in 
accordance with any guidance note, 
standard on assurance engagement or a 
guideline issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) from 
time to time and certified by the statutory 
auditor or chartered accountants with a 
valid Peer Review certificate. 
Companies may disclose this information 
even if acquisitions or disposals occurred 
before the completion of the latest financial 
period. Similarly, companies may also 
disclose financial statements of acquired or 
divested subsidiaries/businesses in QIP, 
provided they are certified by a peer-
reviewed statutory auditor or independent 
chartered accountant. Further, companies 
may voluntarily provide proforma financial 
statements incorporating the information 
with regard to the proposed purchase of 
business or interest in business, that are 
expected to be acquired out of the 
proceeds of the said issue. 
2. Permission to file DRHP where issuers 
have outstanding Stock appreciation 
rights (SARs) granted to employees
At present, Regulation 5 of the ICDR 
Regulations does not permit companies 
with outstanding convertible securities or 
other rights (that allow someone to receive 
equity shares) to file an initial public offer
(IPO). However, companies, that have 
granted options to employees and fully 
paid-up convertible securities that will be 
converted before the filing, are eligible to 
file an IPO. The ICDR Amendments 
Regulations 2025 now allow companies, 
with outstanding SARS granted to 
employees, to file for an IPO.

3. Amendments affecting the promoter / 
promoter group
a. Regulation 8A of the ICDR Regulations 
provides the quantum of shares that 
can be offered for sale by selling 
shareholders in an IPO, if the offer is 
covered under Regulation 6(2) of the 
said Regulations i.e. to undertake an 
IPO under the non-profitability route. In 
order to restrict the selling shareholders 
from selling any additional shares prior 
to the IPO, in secondary transfers 
outside of the IPO, the ICDR 
Amendment Regulations 2025 stipulate 
that the promoters' holdings should be 
calculated as of the date of filing the 
draft offer document, including all 
shares offered for sale to the public and 
any secondary sales prior to the issue.
A new explanation has been added to 
Regulation 8A of the ICDR Regulations 
which clarifies that the calculation to 
determine a promoter's holding should 
be calculated with reference to their 
shareholding as of the date of the draft 
offer document and apply cumulatively 
to the total number of shares offered for 
sale to the public and any secondary 
sale transactions prior to the issue.
b. Regulation 15 of the ICDR Regulations 
provides securities that are ineligible in 
computation of the minimum promoters' 
contribution. The ICDR Amendment 
Regulations 2025 clarify that the price 
per share for these securities should be 
adjusted for corporate actions like share 
splits, bonus issues, etc.
c. Regulation 54 of the ICDR Regulations 
requires reporting of all transactions by 
promoters and the members of the 
promoter group between the date of 
filing of the draft offer document and the 
closure of an issuance to the stock 
exchanges. In order to enhance 
transparency and information available 
for investors, the ICDR Amendment 
Regulations 2025 have expanded this 
requirement to include pre-IPO 
placement transactions. This means 
that issuers will have to report any 
proposed pre-IPO placement mentioned 
in the draft offer document to the stock 
exchanges within 24 hours of the 
transaction.
d. Amendments have been introduced in 
Regulation 16 of the ICDR Regulations 
to clarify that if loans are being repaid 
from the proceeds of the issue, and 
such loans have been utilised for capital 
expenditure, then a longer promoter 
lock-in period shall apply. This was 
done so that the issue proceeds are not 
used as a means of bridge financing for 
capital expenditure without appropriate 
checks and balances contemplated 
under the ICDR Regulations.
e. Clause 5A of paragraph A of part A of 
Schedule III of the LODR Regulations 
requires companies to disclose 
agreements entered into by the 
shareholders, promoters, promoter 
group entities, related parties, directors, 
key managerial personnel, employees 
of the listed entity or of its holding, 
subsidiary or associate company, 
among themselves or with the listed 
entity or with a third party, solely or 
jointly, which, either directly or indirectly 
or potentially or whose purpose and 
effect is to, impact the management or 
control of the listed entity or impose any 
restriction or create any liability upon 
the listed entity. These agreements may 
not be disclosed by issuer companies in 
their offer documents prior to listing. 
Therefore, to align the provisions of 
ICDR Regulations with LODR 
Regulations, SEBI Amendment 
Regulations 2025 have amended 
paragraph (10)(E) of Schedule VI of 
ICDR Regulations. Companies are now 
required to disclose the details of these 
agreements, as mandated by the LODR 
Regulations, in their offer document.

4. IPO objective – repayment of loans
a. If one of the objects of the offer is 
utilisation of issue proceeds to fund 
long- term working capital requirements, 
certain additional disclosures were 
prescribed under paragraph (9)(A)(5) of 
Part A of Schedule VI of the ICDR 
Regulations where information is 
required to be provided on a ‘standalone 
basis’. The ICDR Amendment 
Regulations 2025 clarify that these 
disclosures should be based upon the 
audited standalone financial statements. 
Additionally, if there are restatements or 
adjustments in the consolidated 
financial statements that impact the 
standalone financial statements, the 
standalone financial statements must 
also be restated.
b. ICDR Regulations previously required 
statutory auditors or peer-reviewed 
chartered accountants to certify financial 
information in the offer document, 
including restated financials. However, 
certification of loan utilisation had to be 
done by the statutory auditor. The ICDR 
Amendment Regulations 2025 have 
amended paragraph 9(A) of Schedule 
VI of the ICDR Regulations, permitting 
issuers to obtain the loan utilisation 
certificate either from the company’s 
statutory auditor or from a chartered 
accountant with a valid peer-review 
certificate. This flexibility applies if the 
periods were not audited by the current 
statutory auditor; or if the loan proposed 
to be repaid has been availed by a 
subsidiary where the current statutory 
auditor of the issuer is not the statutory 
auditor of the subsidiary.
5. Harmonisation of provisions of ICDR 
Regulations with LODR Regulations
a. Before the amendment, there was no 
materiality concept for disclosing 
litigations in the offer document, 
although Regulation 30 of LODR 
Regulations had certain thresholds. To 
align the LODR Regulations and ICDR 
Regulations, the ICDR Amendment 
Regulations 2025 have introduced a 
concept of materiality in Paragraph 12 
of Part A of Schedule VI of the ICDR 
Regulations. Further, it requires
companies to disclose all criminal 
proceedings involving key managerial 
personnel and senior management of 
the issuer and actions by regulatory 
authorities and statutory authorities 
against key managerial personnel and 
senior management of the issue.
b. The ICDR Regulations requires issuers 
to appoint a compliance officer to 
redressal of monitor compliance of 
securities laws and for redressal of 
investors’ grievances. However, 
previously no specific qualifications to 
be a compliance officer were stipulated. 
The ICDR Amendment Regulations 
2025 aligns the qualification of a 
compliance officer with the LODR 
Regulations and now specifies that the 
compliance officer must be qualified to 
be a Company Secretary.

c. The ICDR Amendment Regulations 
2025 have aligned certain definitions 
such as associate, employee, financial 
year, securities law, etc. in ICDR 
Regulations with those in the LODR 
Regulations.
6. Rights issue
With an aim to streamline processes and 
offer greater flexibility, the ICDR 
Amendment Regulations 2025 have inter-
alia introduced the following amendments 
to the ICDR Regulations, related to rights 
issue:
a.
removal of the previous monetary 
threshold of INR50 crore for rights 
issue under Regulation 3(b). This 
implies that ICDR Regulations would 
be applicable to all rights issue 
irrespective of the issue size. 
b.
similar to QIPs, the draft letter of offer 
is required to be directly filed with 
stock exchanges for the purpose of 
seeking in-principal listing approvals 
under Regulation 71. The final Letter 
of Offer is then to be submitted to 
SEBI for information and 
dissemination. 
c.
permitting promoters and promoter 
group to renounce their rights 
entitlements to specific investors by 
giving additional disclosures about 
these specific investors and the 
promoter group under Regulation 84.
d.
under Regulation 74, sub-regulation 
(3) and the proviso related to 
reservation for employees along with 
rights issue has been omitted. 
e.
In Regulation 69, issuers are now 
directly responsible for preparing the 
draft letter of offer and letter of offer. 
The erstwhile requirement of 
appointing one or more merchant 
bankers and due diligence thereby, 
has been dispensed with. 
Further, SEBI has also issued a circular 
dated 11 March 2025 on faster rights issue 
with a flexibility of allotment to specific 
investor(s).
Next steps
In today’s dynamic and rapidly evolving 
market environment, regulatory adaptability 
and coherence are essential for sustaining 
investor confidence and market integrity. The 
SEBI ICDR Amendment Regulations 2025 aim 
at harmonising regulations with the LODR 
Regulations. This is a strategic step towards 
strengthening the capital market ecosystem in 
India as this initiative not only simplifies 
procedural requirements for market 
participants but also reflects SEBI’s ongoing 
commitment to enhancing transparency and 
promoting ease of doing business. Also, once 
a company is listed, it will primarily follow the 
LODR Regulations. The harmonisation of the 
ICDR Regulations with the LODR Regulations 
also ensures that there are no conflicting or 
redundant compliance requirements. This 
streamlining helps listed companies maintain 
consistent and efficient compliance practices, 
reducing the regulatory burden and enhancing 
transparency for investors.
By aligning regulatory provisions and reducing 
redundancies, SEBI is fostering a capital 
market that is more transparent, inclusive, and 
conducive to economic growth. These reforms 
contribute to building a more efficient,

LODR Regulations for enhanced corporate governance of HVDLEs amended
The SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 
2025 (Amendments), introduce several 
significant changes aimed at enhancing 
corporate governance norms and compliance 
for listed entities, mainly in relation to High-
Value Debt Listed Entities (HVDLEs). The 
Amendments has also added a new Chapter 
VA for corporate governance norms applicable 
only to HVDLEs. The Amendments clarify that 
HVDLEs with other specified securities listed, 
shall continue to comply with the provisions of 
regulations 15 to 27 of the LODR Regulations. 
The key amendments include:
1. Threshold increase and sunset clause:
• The threshold value of outstanding listed 
non-convertible debt securities has been 
increased from INR500 crore to 
INR1,000 crore for an entity to be 
classified as HVDLE. Entities meeting 
this threshold must comply with additional 
corporate governance norms.
• A sunset clause has been introduced to 
state that the LODR Regulations will 
cease to apply to a HVDLE, after three 
consecutive years, from the time the 
value of outstanding debt remains below 
the specified threshold.
2. Corporate governance norms for 
HVDLEs:
• Board composition: HVDLEs must 
have an optimal mix of executive and 
non-executive directors, with at least 
one-woman director. Non-executive 
directors should constitute at least 50 per 
cent of the board.
• Independent directors: Specific 
criteria for the appointment and 
evaluation of independent directors, 
including limits on the number of 
directorships they can hold.
• Committees: In order to avoid 
constitution of multiple committees by 
HVDLEs, the Amendments provide 
certain flexibility to HVDLEs. The Board 
of Directors may choose that the 
functions of the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee (NRC) and 
Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee 
(SRC) may be discharged by the Board 
of Directors and a separate NRC or SRC 
may not be constituted. Similarly, the 
functions of the Risk Management 
Committee (RMC) may be discharged by 
audit committee or by the board of 
directors instead of constituting a 
separate RMC.
3. Related party transactions (RPTs):
• Enhanced disclosure and approval 
requirements for material RPTs. 
Transactions exceeding INR1,000 crore 
or 10 per cent of the annual consolidated 
turnover must be approved by the audit 
committee and require no-objection 
certificates from debenture trustees and 
debenture holders of listed debt 
securities (issued on or after 
1 April 2025).
• Guidelines to determine material 
transactions have been included 
• Approval requirements in relation to all 
related party transactions and 
subsequent material modifications are 
specified. Omnibus approvals granted 
basis policy on RPTs of HVDLEs, will be 
valid for a period not exceeding 1 year.

NFRA auditor-audit committee interaction series 
The National Financial Reporting Authority 
(NFRA) had launched Auditor-Audit 
Committee interaction series, focuses on 
enhancing communication between auditors 
and audit committees regarding various 
matters in order to improve audit quality and 
protect public interest. As part of these 
interactions, NFRA issued the following:
A. Series 2 on audit strategy and plan:
On 28 March 2025, NFRA published series 2 
that draws auditor’s attention to potential 
questions the Audit Committees/Board of 
Directors may ask auditors in respect of their 
audit strategy and audit plan. Several 
Standards on Auditing (SAs) impact the 
auditor's strategy and plan. SA 300, Planning 
an Audit of Financial Statements provides a 
framework for developing an audit strategy 
and plan, while SA 315, Identifying and 
Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement 
Through Understanding the Entity and its 
Environment and SA 330, The Auditor’s 
Responses to Assessed Risks address risk 
assessment and responses to assessed risks. 
This document lists potential questions that 
audit committees may ask auditors in relation 
to audit strategy and plan such as covering 
communication plans, compliance with 
independence norms, use of experts, and 
identification of significant risks, areas where 
information technology tools are used, etc.
B. Series 3 on audit of related parties:
With the background that Related Party 
Relationships and Related Party Transactions 
(RPTs) have been a source of major frauds in 
the corporate history which have also been 
seen in the recent corporate frauds, NFRA 
published Series 3 in relation to related parties 
on 28 March 2025. This document outlines the 
requirements regarding RPTS under various 
regulations like the Companies Act 2013, the 
LODR Regulations, Ind AS 24, Related Party 
Disclosures and SA 550, Related Parties. 
It also emphasises the importance of 
transparency, accountability, and robust

transactions to ensure the integrity of financial 
statements. The document provides a list of 
potential questions that audit committees may

Clarification on compliance officer’s position in listed entity
SEBI issued a circular on 1 April 2025, 
clarifying the position of the Compliance 
Officer (CO) in the organisation structure of 
the listed entity under Regulation 6 of the 
LODR Regulations. The SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
(Third Amendment Regulations), 2024 dated 
12 December 2024, required that a CO must 
be in whole-time employment of the listed 
entity, not more than one level below the 
board of directors, and designated as a Key 
Managerial Personnel. SEBI has now clarified 
that ‘one-level below the board’ refers to the 
position directly below the Managing Director 
or Whole-time Director(s) as per the 
organisation structure of the listed entity. 
If these positions do not exist, the CO should 
be one level below the Chief Executive Officer 
or the person heading day-to-day affairs of the 
listed company.

SEBI board meeting
On 24 March 2025, SEBI approved certain 
proposals to amend some provisions of the 
SEBI Regulations. Below are some key 
decisions from the SEBI board meeting:
1. Increased threshold for additional 
disclosure requirements for FPIs: As per 
SEBI circular dated 24 August 2023, FPIs 
(individually or as an investor group), 
holding more than INR25,000 crore of 
equity Assets Under Management (AUM) in 
Indian markets are required to disclose 
details of all entities (up to the level of 
natural person) holding any ownership, 
economic interest, or control, on a full look 
through basis, without any thresholds. This 
amendment aimed to increase the 
threshold for additional disclosure 
requirements for Foreign Portfolio Investors 
(FPIs) from INR25,000 crore to INR50,000 
crore of equity AUM in Indian markets. This 
change is in response to the doubling of 
cash equity market trading volumes since 
FY 2022-23, when these limits were set. 
Other disclosure threshold applicable to 
FPI holding more than 50 per cent of its 
equity AUM in a single corporate group 
remains unchanged.
2. Review of Regulation 17 (a) of SEBI 
(AIF) Regulations, 2012: Investments of 
category II AIFs in listed debt securities 
rated 'A' or below will be treated as akin to 
investments in unlisted securities for 
compliance with minimum investment 
conditions in unlisted securities.
3. Easing compliance for category II AIFs: 
Currently, these AIFs must hold a majority 
of their investments in unlisted securities. 
However, recent changes to LODR 
Regulations provide that entities issuing 
listed debt securities can only issue fresh 
debt in a listed form. This could reduce the 
availability of unlisted debt securities, 
complicating compliance with investment 
norms. To address this, the amendment 
provides that the investments of Category II 
AIFs in listed debt securities rated 'A' or 
below to be treated as investments in 
unlisted securities for purpose of 
compliance with minimum investment 
conditions in unlisted securities.
4. Amendments to SEBI (Merchant Bankers) 
Regulations, 1992, SEBI (Debenture 
Trustee) Regulations, 1993, and SEBI 
(Custodians) Regulations 1996 were 
deferred for further review.

Streamlining ESG disclosures and green credits
Following recommendations and public 
consultation, SEBI has revised provisions 
related to the assurance framework and ESG 
disclosures for the value chain and introduced 
new disclosure requirements for green credits. 
Following are the key updates:
• Green credits: Starting FY 2024-25, the 
BRSR includes a new leadership indicator 
requiring disclosures on green credits.
• Assessment or assurance: To streamline 
processes and reduce costs, listed entities 
can opt for either 'assessment' or 
'assurance' for BRSR Core and ESG 
disclosures beginning FY 2024-25.
• ESG disclosures for value chain: The 
requirement for value chain disclosures has 
been postponed by one year. 
Consequently, ESG disclosures for the 
value chain will be voluntary for the top 250 
listed entities (by market capitalisation) from 
FY 2025-26 and mandatory from FY 2026-
27. Reporting of previous year numbers will 
be voluntary for the first year of ESG value 
chain disclosures.
The assessment or assurance of these 
disclosures will be voluntary from FY 2026-
27.

Proposal to widen scope of fast track mergers
On 5 April 2025, the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs (MCA) via a draft notification, 
proposed an amendment to the Companies 
(Compromises, Arrangements and 
Amalgamations) Amendment Rules, 2016 
(CAA Rules), to broaden the scope of fast-
track mergers under Section 233 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (2013 Act). This 
amendment aims to streamline corporate 
restructuring and ease of doing business by 
extending the simplified merger procedures 
to more unlisted and low-debt companies.
Presently, Section 233 of the 2013 Act read 
with Rule 25(1A) of CAA Rules covers mergers
between following class of companies under 
the fast track merger scheme:
a. Merger between two or more small 
companies
b. Merger between a holding company and its 
wholly owned subsidiary
c. Merger between two or more startup 
companies
d. Merger between one or more startup 
company with one or more small company.
The draft suggests that a new set of 
companies should be covered by the fast track 
mergers under Section 233 of the 2013 Act 
which are as follows:
a. merger between unlisted companies (other 
than section 8 companies2) with borrowing 
from banks and financial institutions less 
than INR50 crore and have no default in 
repayment of such borrowings. Such 
companies are required to meet this criteria 
as on a day, not more than 30 days before 
the date of notice referred to in Section 
233(1)(a) of the 2013 Act.
b. merger between a holding company (listed 
or unlisted) and one or more of its unlisted 
subsidiary company/ companies (may or 
may not be a wholly owned subsidiary).
c. merger between subsidiaries of the same 
holding company where the transferor 
company is not listed.
d. merger of a foreign holding company, 
incorporated outside India, with its wholly 
owned subsidiary company being an Indian 
company incorporated in India.
The draft is open for public comments until 
5 May 2025.
(Source: MCA draft notification ‘MCA invites public 
comments on proposed amendment in the Rules to 
widen the scope of fast track mergers under Companies 
Act, 2013; dated 5 April 2025)
2.  Section 8 provides ‘Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Central Government that a person or an association of persons proposed to 
     be registered under this Act as a limited company -
a.
has in its objects the promotion of commerce, art, science, sports, education, research, social welfare, religion, charity, protection of 
environment or any such other object;
b.
intends to apply its profits, if any, or other income in promoting its objects; and
c.

Clarification on treatment of ROU assets
The RBI issued a notification clarifying the 
treatment of Right-of-Use (ROU) assets for 
computation of regulatory capital/owned funds. 
According to Indian Accounting Standard (Ind 
AS) 116, Leases are reflected on a lessee's 
balance sheet as a liability (obligation to make 
lease payments) and a related ROU asset. 
The notification applies to Non-Banking 
Financial Companies (NBFCs) and Asset 
Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) with an 
immediate effect.
Key points of the notification include:
• NBFCs and ARCs are not required to 
deduct ROU assets from owned fund, 
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital, or 
Tier 1 capital, provided the underlying 
leased asset is tangible. 
• ROU assets will be risk-weighted at 100 per 
cent, consistent with the risk weight 
historically applied to owned tangible assets.
These changes have been also incorporated in 
the following directions:
a. Core Investment Companies (Reserve 
Bank) Directions, 2016
b. Mortgage Guarantee Companies (Reserve 
Bank) Directions, 2016 and 
c. Master Direction - Standalone Primary 
Dealers (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016.

The amendments to SEBI (Mutual Funds) 
Regulations,1996 was carried out to facilitate 
ease of doing business for mutual funds, and 
to relax framework relating to ‘Alignment of 
interest of the Designated Employees of the 
Asset Management Companies (AMC) with 
the interest of the unitholders’ through two 
notifications dated 14 February 2025 and 
4 March 2025 respectively. Subsequently, 
SEBI has issued a circular on 21 March 2025 
in order to give effect to these amendments, 
by modifying certain provisions of the Master 
Circular dated 27 June 2024. Key 
amendments include:
• Investment requirements: Designated 
employees must invest a minimum 
percentage of their gross annual 
compensation (net of taxes and statutory 
contributions) in mutual fund schemes they 
oversee. The investment percentages vary 
based on compensation slabs and whether 
Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) 
are included.
• Liquid fund schemes: For employees 
managing liquid fund schemes, up to 75 per 
cent of required investments can be made 
in higher-risk schemes managed by the 
AMC.
• Lock-in period adjustments: Upon 
retirement at superannuation age, units will 
be released from lock-in except in close-
ended schemes. On resignation or 
retirement, lock-in period will be reduced to 
1 year from the end of the employment or 
the completion date of the 3-year lock-in, 
whichever is earlier. Post lock-in, units in 
open-ended schemes can be redeemed, 
subject to SEBI insider trading regulations 
and pre-clearance requirements.
• Disclosure and compliance: AMCs must 
disclose aggregate compensation invested 
in units for the designated employees on 
stock exchange websites quarterly within 15 
calendar days from end of each quarter. 
Additionally, violations of the code of 
conduct by designated employees will be 
reviewed by the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee (NRC) and in 
absence of NRC by the Board of Directors 
of the AMC which will then provide 
recommendations to SEBI for consideration, 
after approval from Trustees.
These amendments aim to strengthen the 
alignment of employee interests with those of 
investors, enhancing transparency and 
accountability within AMCs. The changes will 
be effective from 1 April 2025.

The RBI issued a notification on 
29 March 2025, revising the norms for 
government guaranteed Security Receipts 
(SRs) with an aim to provide a differentiated 
approach for SRs with sovereign guarantees, 
ensuring prudential treatment relating to 
valuation of such SRs. These revised norms 
apply to all commercial banks, co-operative 
banks, financial institutions, and NBFCs.
The treatment relating to valuation and 
provisioning is as follows:
1. If a loan is transferred to an Asset 
Reconstruction Company (ARC) for a value 
higher than the net book value (NBV), the 
excess provision can be reversed to the 
profit and loss account in year of sale if the 
sale consideration includes only cash and 
SRs guaranteed by the Government of 
India.
2. The non-cash component (SRs) must be 
deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 
1) capital, and no dividends can be paid 
from this component.
3. SRs will be valued periodically based on 
the Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the 
ARC, considering recovery ratings.
4. Unrealised gains from fair valuation of SRs 
must be deducted from CET 1 capital, and 
no dividends can be paid from these 
unrealised gains.
5. SRs outstanding after the government 
guarantee expires or is settled, will be 
valued at INR1.
6. If SRs are converted to other instruments 
as part of resolution, their valuation and 
provisioning will follow the Prudential 
Framework for Resolution of Stressed 
Assets dated 7 June 2019.
These provisions are effective immediately 
and apply to all existing and future 
investments involving SRs guaranteed by the 
Government of India.

SEBI clarification on SIF framework
SEBI issued a circular on 9 April 2025, 
providing clarifications stated below on the 
regulatory framework for Specialized 
Investment Funds (SIFs):
1. Interval investment strategies: The 
maturity provisions for securities in interval 
schemes, as outlined in the Master Circular 
for Mutual Funds dated 27 June 2024, will 
not apply to interval investment strategies 
under SIF.
2. Minimum investment threshold: The 
minimum investment threshold has been 
modified. An investor's aggregate 
investment across all SIF strategies at the 
Permanent Account Number (PAN) level 
must be at least INR10 lakh. This threshold 
does not apply to mandatory investments 
made by AMCs for designated employees.
This clarification aims to ensure consistent 
application of the SIF framework and protect 
investor interests and is effective immediately.

To promote ease of doing business and 
enhance the regulatory framework for 
Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) and 
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), SEBI 
has issued circulars on 28 March 2025 to 
amend the master circulars for InvITs and 
REITs respectively. The main amendments 
covered therein are as follows:
1. Lock-in provisions for preferential issue 
of units: The existing regulations provide 
that the sponsor and sponsor group of 
InvIT and REITs must hold a minimum of 
15 per cent of the total units for three years 
from the listing date in case of InvIT and 
from the date of trading approval in case of 
a REIT. The summary of the amendment is 
as follows:
a. InvITs: If the project manager is the 
sponsor or an associate, sponsors and 
sponsor groups are required to hold 15 
per cent of the units for three years from 
the listing date. Otherwise, 25 per cent 
of the units must be locked in for three 
years form the listing date. The 
remaining units are subject to a one 
year lock in period.
b. REITs: Sponsors and sponsor groups 
must retain at least 15 per cent of the 
total units for three years from the date 
of the initial offer listing. The updated 
requirements specify that 15 per cent of 
the units allotted to sponsors and 
sponsor groups will be locked in for three 
years from the date of trading approval, 
while the remaining units will be locked in 
for one year. 
2. Inter-se transfer of locked in units: In 
case of both InvIT and REITs locked-in 
units allotted under a preferential issue to a 
sponsor can be transferred among sponsor 
or sponsor group entities, subject to the 
condition that the original lock-in period 
shall continue with the transferee. Further 
the transferee will not be eligible to transfer 
such units till expiry of the original lock in 
period. In case of change in sponsor, 
transfer of lock in units will be allowed to 
the incoming sponsor or sponsor group 
provided the incoming sponsor shall 
continue to comply with minimum unit 
holding requirements
3. Guidelines for follow-on offer3: Follow-on 
offers have been introduced as a method 
for raising funds after the initial public offer 
for both InvITs and REITs. The provisions 
applicable to a public issue of units of an 
InvIT/REIT will also be applicable for follow-
on offers by them. The circular provides for 
the framework of follow on offer specifying 
therein various requirements such as 
application to be made to all stock 
exchanges on which units are listed for an 
in principal approval, mandatorily issuing 
units in dematerialised form, ensuring a 
minimum public unit holding of 25 per cent 
of the total outstanding units post-issue, 
adhering to specified timelines for the 
allotment and listing of units and it also 
includes a restriction on further issue of 
units in any form (public issue, rights issue 
preferential issue) by both InvIT and REIT 
during the period from date of filing of draft 
follow-on offer document to the listing of the 
units or refund of application monies as 
applicable.
4. Additional provisions applicable to InvIT 
and REITs: 
a. Provision for payment of interest under 
a follow-on offer in case of failure to allot 
or list units
b. Requirement to submit due-diligence 
certificate to SEBI along with the draft 
follow-on offer document.
These circulars are effective from 
28 March 2025.

The RBI amended below rates through a 
series of notifications issued on 9 April 2025, 
effective immediately:
1. Reduction in penal interest rate on CRR 
and SLR: RBI reduced the bank rate by 25 
basis points, from 6.50 per cent to 6.25 per 
cent. Consequently, RBI reduced all penal 
interest rates for banks in relation to 
shortfall to meet Cash Reserve Ratio 
(CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) 
requirements by RBI by 25 basis points. 
2. Reduction in Standing Liquidity Facility 
(SLF)4: RBI reduced the policy repo rate 
under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility 
(LAF)5 by 25 basis points, lowering it from 
6.25 per cent to 6.00 per cent. 
Consequently, the SLF provided to Primary 
Dealers (PDs), which offer collateralised 
liquidity support, will now be available at the 
revised repo rate of 6.00 per cent.
3. Reduction in standing deposit facility 
(SDF)6: Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) 
of the RBI has reduced the policy repo rate 
under the LAF by 25 basis points from 6.25 
per cent to 6 per cent. Consequently, the 
SDF rate is adjusted to 5.75 per cent and 
the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate is 
adjusted to 6.25 per cent.

Various rates amended by RBI to align with the monetary policy
4.
A Standing Liquidity Facility (SLF) is a program offered by the RBI to standalone primary dealers, providing them with additional funds at the 
prevailing repo rate. It's a collateralised facility used to address liquidity needs, especially for primary dealers. 
5.
 The Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) is a monetary policy tool used by central banks like the RBI to manage liquidity in the financial 
system. It allows banks to borrow funds from the central bank (repo) or lend excess funds to the central bank (reverse repo). This helps 
banks adjust their day-to-day liquidity needs and influences short-term interest rates. 
6.
 A Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) is a monetary policy tool used by central banks to absorb excess liquidity from the banking system. It 
allows banks to deposit their excess funds with the central bank without requiring collateral. Essentially, it's a mechanism to manage liquidity 
and control inflation by reducing the amount of money circulating in the economy

On 9 April 2025, RBI issued certain draft 
directions under the statement on 
developmental and regulatory policies which 
are open for comments until 12 May 2025. 
Following are various directions issued:
1. RBI (Co-Lending Arrangements) 
Directions, 2025: The document outlines a 
comprehensive framework for co-lending 
arrangements (CLAs) between REs to 
extend credit to borrowers. It was noticed 
that while there are separate guidelines 
covering some of these arrangements, for 
example digital lending, co-lending by 
banks with NBFCs to priority sector, as well 
as applicable guidelines on outsourcing of 
financial services, such regulatory 
frameworks do not cover all the possible 
categories of co-lending arrangements. 
Accordingly, a comprehensive market 
enabling draft framework has been 
prepared to specify the regulatory norms 
and guidance for all such CLAs, in general, 
while addressing certain prudential issues.
2. RBI (Securitisation of Stressed Assets) 
Directions, 2025: The draft outlines a 
framework for the securitisation of stressed 
assets by REs, including banks and 
NBFCs. It specifies eligibility criteria for 
assets, operational requirements, risk 
retention norms, and the roles of special 
purpose entities and resolution managers. 
The framework intends to enable 
securitisation of stressed assets through a 
market-based mechanism, in addition to 
the existing ARC route under the 
Securitisation and Reconstruction of 
Financial Assets and Enforcement of 
Security Interest Act, 2002. The draft also 
includes detailed guidelines on reporting, 
disclosures, and capital requirements for 
securitisation notes.
3. RBI (Non-Fund Based Credit Facilities) 
Directions, 2025: The draft outlines a 
regulatory framework for Non-Fund Based 
(NFB) credit exposures by banks and 
NBFCs. NFBs facilitate guarantees, letters 
of credit, co-acceptances, etc. and play a 
significant role in facilitating effective credit 
intermediation, besides enabling seamless 
business transactions, including trade 
transactions. The draft aims to harmonise 
regulations across REs. The revised 
guidelines include a review of instructions 
on issuance of partial credit enhancement 
by REs, with a view to, inter alia, 
broadening funding sources for 
infrastructure financing.
4. RBI (Lending Against Gold Collateral) 
Directions, 2025: Loans against the 
collateral of gold jewellery and ornaments 
are extended by REs for both consumption 
and income-generation purposes. 
Prudential and conduct related regulations 
for such loans have been issued from time 
to time and they vary for different 
categories of REs. The draft aims to 
harmonise regulations across REs. The 
draft proposes comprehensive prudential 
norms and conduct-related regulations, 
considering the risk-taking capabilities of 
various REs and addressing observed 
concerns. 
The drafts are open for comments until 
12 May 2025.

The International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board (IAASB) has issued the 
revised ISA 570 (Revised 2024), Going 
Concern. This revision, effective for audits of 
financial statements for periods beginning on 
or after 15 December 2026, aims to increase 
consistency in auditing practices and 
strengthen transparency through 
communications and auditor reporting on 
matters related to going concern in a 
consistent manner. Key changes include:
• Robust risk assessment procedures: 
Auditors must conduct timely and thorough 
risk assessments to identify events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on an entity's ability to continue as a going 
concern. The standard provides clarity by 
emphasising on such events or conditions 
on a gross basis – before considering 
management’s mitigation factors.
• Period of management’s assessment: 
Evaluation of management period for going 
concern assessment for at least twelve 
months from the date of financial statement 
approval. Auditors must evaluate 
management's assessment, considering 
potential biases, methods, assumptions, 
and data used.
• Enhanced transparency: Clearer 
communication in audit reports about 
responsibilities and work related to going 
concern and strengthened communications 
with governance and external parties. 
• Other aspects: There is also increased 
focus on adequacy of disclosures, clarity on 
relation with key audit matters, new 
guidance and examples for the evolving 
environment, strengthened documentation 
requirements for auditors and management 
representation requirements.

Revised ISA 570 on going concern – IAASB 
IAASB issues guide for ISA for LCE
The International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board (IAASB) has released a
new ‘First-Time Implementation Guide – The 
International Standard on Auditing of Financial 
Statement of Less Complex Entities (ISA for 
LCE)’. This guide provides an overview of the 
standard's concepts, structure, and format, 
with step-by-step insights and examples to 
help practitioners implement the ISA 
effectively.
The guide is available on the IAASB website 
and complements other resources like an 
adoption guide, supplementary guidance, 
videos, and webinars. The guidance does not 
change the authoritative text of the ISA for LCE 
but helps in understanding and applying it.

First Notes
Related party transactions – Minimum information for review
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations) 
requires Related Party Transactions (RPTs) to be approved by the Audit Committee and, where applicable, by the shareholders. 
To facilitate a uniform approach and assist listed entities in complying with these requirements, SEBI issued a circular on 14 February 2025, 
specifying that listed entities should comply with the Industry Standards on ‘Minimum information to be provided for Review of the Audit Committee 
and Shareholders for approval of an RPT’ (RPT Industry Standards) effective 1 July 2025. The RPT Industry Standards have been formulated by the 
Industry Standards Forum (ISF), comprising representatives from three industry associations: Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of 
India (ASSOCHAM), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) in consultation 
with SEBI. 
This issue of First Notes aims to provide an overview of the Industry Standards issued for minimum requirements for the approval of RPTs.

Determining the lease term, as per Ind AS 116, Leases, involves significant judgement, particularly in assessing enforceable rights, extension options, and termination clauses. It requires lessees to look at contractual terms in conjunction with the broader economic incentives and factors influencing lease decisions to determine lease term.

Editorial
The determination of lease term is a critical area 
requiring careful judgement, particularly in 
assessing enforceable rights, extension options, 
and termination clauses. Ind AS 116, Leases, 
requires lessees to look at the contractual terms in 
conjunction with the broader economic incentives 
and factors influencing lease decisions to 
determine lease term. This edition of Accounting 
and Auditing Update (AAU) includes an article that 
discusses the key factors involved in determining 
the lease term, along with the complexities of 
lease modifications and lease re-assessments 
along with case studies.
In March 2025, the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (SEBI) responded to the evolving 
needs to the issuer companies by introducing the 
SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure 
Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 2025 
(ICDR Amendment Regulations 2025). These 
amendments bring several changes aimed at 
streamlining compliance and enhancing the 
efficiency and transparency of fundraising 
processes. Our article provides an overview of the 
ICDR Amendment Regulations 2025 discussing 
the key amendments such as introduction of 
voluntary proforma financials in Qualified 
Institutions Placement, amendments affecting the 
promoter / promoter group, simplification of rights 
issue process, harmonisation of provisions of SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 and SEBI (Issue of Capital and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018, etc.
There have been various regulatory developments 
in India and internationally during the month. 
The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises (MSMEs) issued a notification 
announcing significant changes to the financial 
thresholds that define MSME classification. 
Additionally, SEBI issued the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
(Amendment) Regulations, 2025 aimed at 
enhancing corporate governance norms and 
compliance for listed entities, mainly in relation to 
High-Value Debt Listed Entities (HVDLEs). 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued certain 
clarifications to the RBI (Financial Statements - 
Presentation and Disclosures) Directions, 2021, in 
relation to presentation and disclosures in the 
financial statements, applicable to all commercial 
and cooperative banks for the financial year ended 
31 March 2025 and onwards. The National 
Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) released 
series 2 and series 3 of the ‘Auditor-Audit 
Committee Interactions Series’ covering audit 
strategy and plan and audit of related parties 
respectively.
Our regulatory updates section covers these and 
other important regulatory developments.
We would be delighted to receive 
feedback/suggestions from you on the topics we 
should cover in the forthcoming editions of AAU.

A lease is a contractual agreement where 
one party (the lessor) grants another party 
(the lessee) the right to use an asset for a 
specified period in exchange for periodic 
payments. Leases are fundamental in various 
sectors, including real estate, equipment 
rental, and vehicle leasing, providing flexibility 
and financial efficiency for businesses and 
individuals alike.
The lease term is a critical aspect of lease 
agreements. It defines the duration for which 
the lessee has the right to use the leased 
asset. Accurately determining the lease term 
is essential because it impacts the financial 
reporting and classification of leases. Ind AS 
116, Leases provides detailed guidance 
for determining the lease term since this is one 
of the key judgement area and can 
significantly affect the amounts recognised in 
the financial statements. Another accounting 
challenge arises when there is a change in 
the lease term during the lease tenure. 
Determining whether this change constitutes 
a modification or a change of estimate is 
crucial for accurate financial reporting to 
reflect the current lease obligations and 
provide transparency to stakeholders.
This article discusses the key aspects 
relevant in determination of lease term 
when accounting for a lease contract.

Lease term
A lease term, as per Ind AS 116, refers to the 
non-cancellable period for which a lessee has 
the right to use an underlying asset. 
This period includes:
• Periods covered by an option to extend the 
lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to 
exercise that option and
• Periods covered by an option to terminate 
the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain 
not to exercise that option.
The below diagram illustrates how the lease 
term may be determined:

• The non-cancellable period under Ind AS 
116 refers to the duration when the lessee 
cannot terminate the lease agreement. 
Consequently, lease term cannot be shorter 
than the non-cancellable period. A lease 
agreement may grant each party the 
unilateral right to terminate the lease, for 
any reason and with no more than an 
insignificant penalty by giving certain notice. 
The non-cancellable period of the lease in 
such cases includes the 'notice' period.
• An enforceable period is the maximum 
length of the lease term.
To determine the enforceable period of the 
lease, an entity applies the definition of a 
contract. An enforceable period under Ind AS 
116 refers to the duration during which the 
lessee and the lessor have enforceable rights 
and obligations. This period is significant in 
determining the lease term, as it includes 
periods where the lease can be enforced by 
either party, even if the lessee has the option 
to extend or terminate the lease. A lease is no 
longer 'enforceable' when both the lessee and 
lessor have the right to terminate it without 
agreement from the other party with no more 
than an insignificant penalty.

To summarise, in determining the lease term, an entity first determines the enforceable period 
and non-cancellable period of the contract.  It then determines where—within the range between 
the non-cancellable period (minimum lease term) and the enforceable period (maximum lease 
term)—the lease term falls.
The key steps to determine the enforceable period are as follows:
Assess the contract broadly – i.e. the combined effects of the following
Determine the enforceable period
Consider the written 
contract terms and 
conditions
Consider the 
relevant laws and 
regulations
Consider penalties and 
termination rights

Some of these principles are illustrated 
through by way of case studies to provide 
practical application of the guidance.
Case Study 1 – Lessee’s option to 
renew lease
Facts:
• Lessee A enters into a lease contract with 
Lessor L to lease a building. 
• The non-cancellable period is 4 years 
• A has the option to extend the lease by 
another 4 years at the same rent
• Market rentals for a comparable building in 
the same area are expected to increase by 
10% over 8 years 
• A intends to stay in business in the same 
area for at least 10 years.
• A has undertaken significant leasehold 
improvements with useful life of 9 years.
Analysis: 
Lessor A should consider the following factors 
to determine the lease term:
• Market rentals for similar properties: At 
the commencement date, rentals under 
the contract reflect the current market 
rates. Further, market rentals for a 
comparable building in the same area 
are expected to increase over the 8 year 
enforceable period
• Strategic reasons: A intends to stay in this 
business in the same area for at least 10 
years. Further, the location of the building 
is ideal for relationships with suppliers and 
customers
• Leasehold improvements: The fact that A 
has undertaken non-removable significant 
leasehold improvements with an estimated 
useful life higher than the enforceable 
period.
Conclusion:
• Lessor A concludes that it has a significant 
economic incentive to extend the lease and 
therefore, is reasonably certain to exercise 
its 4 year extension option. 
• Consequently, A determines that the lease 
term is 8 years.
Key judgements involved when 
a lessee is required to 
determine lease term
Determining the lease term does require 
significant judgement. Some examples of 
judgements involved in determining the lease 
period include:
a. Assessment of economic penalties to be 
considered in assessing the enforceable 
period since an entity applies the definition 
of a contract to determine the enforceable 
period. Enforceability is a matter of law in 
the relevant jurisdiction and each contract 
will need to be evaluated based on its 
terms and conditions;
b. Evaluation of reasonably certainty of 
exercising the termination option. When 
determining the lease term, an entity is 
required to consider all relevant facts and 
circumstances that create an economic 
incentive for the lessee to exercise an 
option to renew or not to exercise an 
option to terminate early. For example – 
• factors such as the significance of 
leasehold improvements 
• importance of the leased asset to the 
lessee’s operations
• past practice regarding the exercise of 
renewal or termination options
• market rentals for similar properties
• strategic reasons for the lessee to 
either stay in the current lease or 
relocate.
The longer the period until the option 
exercise date, the more compelling the 
evidence needs to be that the lessee 
will exercise the option. 
This is due to the 
increasing uncertainty 
of economic conditions 
and incentives as the 
date approaches.

In a different situation, if all the other facts 
of the case remain the same, except that the 
agreement states that the terms and 
conditions for the renewal of 4 additional 
years will be determined and mutually agreed 
at the time of renewal , it would be 
appropriate to conclude that there is no 
enforceable period. This is because there are 
no terms specified in the contract for the 
renewal period and both parties could choose 
to terminate the lease without any significant 
penalties. Accordingly, the lease term in that 
case would be 4 years.
Another common situation that requires 
analysis when there are alterations in lease 
terms – to determine whether it’s a lease 
term reassessment or a lease modification. 
This assessment will impact the accounting 
of lease liability, and the right-of-use asset 
recognised on the balance sheet.

1.
The modification is accounted as a 
separate lease if both conditions are 
satisfied:
•
modification increases the scope of 
lease by adding right to use one or 
more underlying assets and 
•
consideration for the lease increases
by the amount equivalent to the 
standalone price of increase in scope 
and appropriate adjustments to reflect 
contract specific circumstances
The lessee does not revise the discount rate for the 
original lease.
However, the lessee uses a new discount rate to 
account a separate lease. The new rate is determined 
at the effective date of modification. The lessee uses 
the interest rate implicit in the lease if it is readily 
determinable, otherwise the lessee uses its 
incremental borrowing rate. 
Lease modification
A lease modification is defined as a change 
in the scope of a lease, or the consideration 
for a lease, that was not part of the original 
terms and conditions of the lease. Common 
examples are:
• adding or terminating the right to use one 
or more underlying assets
• extending or shortening the contractual 
lease term
• changing the consideration.
Although the lease modification guidance 
is complex, there are essentially two possible 
outcomes:
2. The modification is not 
accounted as a separate lease
The lessee remeasures the lease liability using a revised 
discount rate 
Modifications that decrease the scope of lease: 
Remeasure lease liability by allocating consideration in the 
modified contract, determining the lease term of the modified 
lease and remeasuring lease liability by discounting payments 
using revised discount rate. The revised discount rate is 
determined as:
•
the interest rate implicit in the lease for the remainder of the 
lease term, if can be readily determined, or 
•
the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of 
the modification, if implicit interest rate cannot be readily 
determined.
Adjust carrying value of ROU to reflect partial/ full termination of 
lease and recognise in profit or loss any differential as gain/loss 
pursuant to partial/ full lease termination
Other modifications:

Lessees must carefully evaluate the 
financial implications of lease modifications, 
considering factors such as the remaining 
lease term, the incremental borrowing rate, 
and any changes in lease payments. 
This process requires a detailed 
understanding of the lease agreement and the 
lessee's business operations, as well as the 
ability to make informed judgements about 
future economic benefits and obligations.
Below case study illustrates the above 
concepts:
Case Study 2
Facts:
• Entity X (lessee) enters into an arrangement 
to lease an office space measuring 2,000 
sq. ft. for a period of 10 years. 
• Entity X makes the annual lease payments 
of INR100,000 per annum 
• The lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at 
the commencement of the lease is 10% p.a.  
• Entity X enters into a lease modification at 
beginning of year 6 whereby the total term 
of the contract is reduced from 10 to 8 
years.  
• The annual lease payments for the space 
measuring 2,000 sq. ft. remains unchanged.
• The lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at 
beginning of year 6 is 11% p.a. 
• The carrying value at the beginning of the 
6th year are as follows: Lease liability - 
INR379,078 and ROU asset - INR307,228
How will Entity X account for the changes in 
the terms of the lease?
Solution: 
• The two conditions to determine whether a 
whether a modification results in a separate 
lease is analysed - 
a. modification increases the scope of 
lease by adding right to use one or more 
underlying assets and 
b. consideration for the lease increases by 
the amount equivalent to the standalone 
price of increase in scope and 
appropriate adjustments to reflect 
contract specific circumstances
• In the given case, since there is only 
decrease in lease term, both the conditions 
are not satisfied
• Thus, the lease modification does not 
amount to a separate lease 
• Step 1: After the modification (at the 
beginning of year 6),  lessee remeasures 
the lease liability with remaining lease term 
of 3 years and incremental borrowing rate of 
11%. The changed lease liability comes to 
INR244,371
• Step 2: Calculate values of ROU and lease 
liability for the remaining term which is 
reduced from 5 to 3 years.

• Gain on lease modification: Income 
accounted at the beginning of year 6 on 
account of reduction in lease term 
amounts – INR7,501 (130,392- 122,891)
• Effect of revised incremental borrowing 
rate adjusted in ROU asset: The 
incremental borrowing rate increased from 
10% to 11%. The effect of an increase in 
the interest rate from 10% to 11% on the 
lease liability amounts to INR4,315 
(2,48,686 - INR 244,371).

Lease reassessment
Lease modifications are different from lease 
reassessment. After the commencement 
date, lease reassessments take place when 
there are changes in certain contractual 
clauses included in the original contract. 
Common examples of such scenarios are:
• assessment of lease term
• whether a purchase option will be 
exercised
• variable lease payments becoming fixed or 
in-substance fixed payments.
A lessee does not reassess options at every 
reporting date just because market conditions 
change. Instead, they use judgement to spot 
major events or significant changes that 
require reassessment.
In case of lease term reassessment, after the 
commencement date, a lessee reassesses 
whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an 
option to extend the lease or not to exercise 
an option to terminate the lease early. 
The lessee does this when there has been a 
significant event or a significant change in 
circumstances that:   
• is within its control; and
• affects whether it is reasonably certain 
to exercise those options.
Some of the examples of significant events 
and changes in circumstances include:
• significant leasehold improvements that 
the lessee did not anticipate at the 
commencement date, if it expects them 
to have a significant economic benefit 
when the option to extend or terminate 
the lease becomes exercisable
• a significant modification to, or 
customisation of, the underlying asset 
that was not anticipated at the 
commencement date, 
• a business decision of the lessee that 
is directly relevant to exercising, or not 
exercising, an option - e.g. a decision to 
extend the lease of a complementary 
asset etc.
In addition, a lessee revises the lease 
term and remeasures the lease liability when 
there is a change in the non-cancellable 
period of a lease.

Accounting of reassessment of lease term 
is discussed by way of below cash study:
Case Study 3 – Lease reassessment
With the same facts as discussed in case 
study 2, if it was a reassessment of lease term 
from 10 years to 8 years, then the impact is 
only lease liability and ROU the lease liability 
is required to be remeasured at a revised 
discount rate.
Carrying value of lease liability 
at beginning of 6th year (A)
379,078
After the modification (at the 
beginning of year 6), the 
remeasured lease liability at 
the incremental borrowing rate 
of 11% (B)
244,371
(with remaining lease 
term of 3 years)
Difference in lease liability 
(A-B)
134,707
Above difference is debited to lease liability 
and credited to ROU. 
Next steps
Determining the lease term requires significant 
judgement. This is because the lease term 
directly affects the recognition of lease 
liabilities and right-of-use assets on the 
balance sheet, which in turn impacts an 
entity's financial position and performance. 
An entity is expected to consider all relevant 
facts and circumstances that create an 
economic incentive as the lessee, when 
assessing whether it is reasonably certain to 
extend (or not to terminate) a lease – this 
includes significant leasehold improvements 
(taken or planned to be taken) over the term 
of the contract that are expected to have 
significant economic benefit when the option 
to extend (or terminate) becomes exercisable. 
Additionally, an entity considers the 
economics of the contract when determining 
the enforceable period of a lease – e.g. costs 
of abandoning or dismantling leasehold 
improvements, expectations that leasehold 
improvements will be used beyond the date on 
which a contract can be terminated – the 
existence of the leasehold improvements 
indicates that an entity may incur more than 
an insignificant penalty. 
These judgements require a thorough 
understanding of both the lease agreement 
and the lessee's business operations. 
Management must carefully evaluate all 
relevant factors to ensure that the lease term 
estimation aligns with the company's 
economic realities and strategic objectives. 
Appropriate qualitative and quantitative 
disclosures in relation to leases as required by 
Ind AS 116, including due to modifications and 
disclosures in relation to judgements applied 
and estimations done should be included in 
financial statements.  Additionally, it is 
essential to continuously review and update 
these judgements to reflect any significant 
changes in circumstances or new information 
that may affect the lease term. This ongoing 
reassessment helps maintain the accuracy 
and reliability of the financial statements, 
ensuring that they provide a true and fair view 
of the company's lease obligations and 
financial position.

In an effort to ease compliance and reduce 
costs, the Government of India in the Union 
Budget for FY 2023-24 announced that the 
financial sector regulators would conduct a 
comprehensive review of the existing 
regulations, incorporating suggestions from the 
public and regulated entities. In line with this 
objective, on 24 August 2023, an Expert 
Committee was constituted to review the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR 
Regulations) and Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2018 (ICDR 
Regulations). The aim of the Expert 
Committee was to harmonise the provisions of 
these regulations and to promote ease of 
doing business. 
Subsequently, Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (SEBI), through a press release on

Key Amendments
The ICDR Amendment Regulations 2025, 
have inter-alia, introduced or amended the 
following:
1. Voluntarily disclosure of proforma 
financials
Schedule VI – Disclosures in the offer 
document, abridged prospectus and 
abridged letter of offer of the SEBI ICDR 
Regulations required companies to include 
proforma financial statements in their offer 
documents if they had a significant 
acquisition or disposal (20 per cent or more 
of turnover, net worth, or profit/loss) after 
the latest financial period but before filing 
the offer document. Companies could also 
voluntarily include proforma statements 
even if the changes were below this 
threshold. However, the SEBI ICDR 
Regulations did not have an enabling 
regulation to voluntarily include proforma 
financial statements or the disclosure of 
proforma financials for acquisitions or 
divestments in a placement document for a 
qualified institutions placement (QIPs).
The ICDR Amendment Regulations 2025 
allows companies to voluntarily include 
proforma statements for such fiscal periods 
as it deems necessary. These proforma 
financial statements should be prepared in 
accordance with any guidance note, 
standard on assurance engagement or a 
guideline issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) from 
time to time and certified by the statutory 
auditor or chartered accountants with a 
valid Peer Review certificate. 
Companies may disclose this information 
even if acquisitions or disposals occurred 
before the completion of the latest financial 
period. Similarly, companies may also 
disclose financial statements of acquired or 
divested subsidiaries/businesses in QIP, 
provided they are certified by a peer-
reviewed statutory auditor or independent 
chartered accountant. Further, companies 
may voluntarily provide proforma financial 
statements incorporating the information 
with regard to the proposed purchase of 
business or interest in business, that are 
expected to be acquired out of the 
proceeds of the said issue. 
2. Permission to file DRHP where issuers 
have outstanding Stock appreciation 
rights (SARs) granted to employees
At present, Regulation 5 of the ICDR 
Regulations does not permit companies 
with outstanding convertible securities or 
other rights (that allow someone to receive 
equity shares) to file an initial public offer
(IPO). However, companies, that have 
granted options to employees and fully 
paid-up convertible securities that will be 
converted before the filing, are eligible to 
file an IPO. The ICDR Amendments 
Regulations 2025 now allow companies, 
with outstanding SARS granted to 
employees, to file for an IPO.

3. Amendments affecting the promoter / 
promoter group
a. Regulation 8A of the ICDR Regulations 
provides the quantum of shares that 
can be offered for sale by selling 
shareholders in an IPO, if the offer is 
covered under Regulation 6(2) of the 
said Regulations i.e. to undertake an 
IPO under the non-profitability route. In 
order to restrict the selling shareholders 
from selling any additional shares prior 
to the IPO, in secondary transfers 
outside of the IPO, the ICDR 
Amendment Regulations 2025 stipulate 
that the promoters' holdings should be 
calculated as of the date of filing the 
draft offer document, including all 
shares offered for sale to the public and 
any secondary sales prior to the issue.
A new explanation has been added to 
Regulation 8A of the ICDR Regulations 
which clarifies that the calculation to 
determine a promoter's holding should 
be calculated with reference to their 
shareholding as of the date of the draft 
offer document and apply cumulatively 
to the total number of shares offered for 
sale to the public and any secondary 
sale transactions prior to the issue.
b. Regulation 15 of the ICDR Regulations 
provides securities that are ineligible in 
computation of the minimum promoters' 
contribution. The ICDR Amendment 
Regulations 2025 clarify that the price 
per share for these securities should be 
adjusted for corporate actions like share 
splits, bonus issues, etc.
c. Regulation 54 of the ICDR Regulations 
requires reporting of all transactions by 
promoters and the members of the 
promoter group between the date of 
filing of the draft offer document and the 
closure of an issuance to the stock 
exchanges. In order to enhance 
transparency and information available 
for investors, the ICDR Amendment 
Regulations 2025 have expanded this 
requirement to include pre-IPO 
placement transactions. This means 
that issuers will have to report any 
proposed pre-IPO placement mentioned 
in the draft offer document to the stock 
exchanges within 24 hours of the 
transaction.
d. Amendments have been introduced in 
Regulation 16 of the ICDR Regulations 
to clarify that if loans are being repaid 
from the proceeds of the issue, and 
such loans have been utilised for capital 
expenditure, then a longer promoter 
lock-in period shall apply. This was 
done so that the issue proceeds are not 
used as a means of bridge financing for 
capital expenditure without appropriate 
checks and balances contemplated 
under the ICDR Regulations.
e. Clause 5A of paragraph A of part A of 
Schedule III of the LODR Regulations 
requires companies to disclose 
agreements entered into by the 
shareholders, promoters, promoter 
group entities, related parties, directors, 
key managerial personnel, employees 
of the listed entity or of its holding, 
subsidiary or associate company, 
among themselves or with the listed 
entity or with a third party, solely or 
jointly, which, either directly or indirectly 
or potentially or whose purpose and 
effect is to, impact the management or 
control of the listed entity or impose any 
restriction or create any liability upon 
the listed entity. These agreements may 
not be disclosed by issuer companies in 
their offer documents prior to listing. 
Therefore, to align the provisions of 
ICDR Regulations with LODR 
Regulations, SEBI Amendment 
Regulations 2025 have amended 
paragraph (10)(E) of Schedule VI of 
ICDR Regulations. Companies are now 
required to disclose the details of these 
agreements, as mandated by the LODR 
Regulations, in their offer document.

4. IPO objective – repayment of loans
a. If one of the objects of the offer is 
utilisation of issue proceeds to fund 
long- term working capital requirements, 
certain additional disclosures were 
prescribed under paragraph (9)(A)(5) of 
Part A of Schedule VI of the ICDR 
Regulations where information is 
required to be provided on a ‘standalone 
basis’. The ICDR Amendment 
Regulations 2025 clarify that these 
disclosures should be based upon the 
audited standalone financial statements. 
Additionally, if there are restatements or 
adjustments in the consolidated 
financial statements that impact the 
standalone financial statements, the 
standalone financial statements must 
also be restated.
b. ICDR Regulations previously required 
statutory auditors or peer-reviewed 
chartered accountants to certify financial 
information in the offer document, 
including restated financials. However, 
certification of loan utilisation had to be 
done by the statutory auditor. The ICDR 
Amendment Regulations 2025 have 
amended paragraph 9(A) of Schedule 
VI of the ICDR Regulations, permitting 
issuers to obtain the loan utilisation 
certificate either from the company’s 
statutory auditor or from a chartered 
accountant with a valid peer-review 
certificate. This flexibility applies if the 
periods were not audited by the current 
statutory auditor; or if the loan proposed 
to be repaid has been availed by a 
subsidiary where the current statutory 
auditor of the issuer is not the statutory 
auditor of the subsidiary.
5. Harmonisation of provisions of ICDR 
Regulations with LODR Regulations
a. Before the amendment, there was no 
materiality concept for disclosing 
litigations in the offer document, 
although Regulation 30 of LODR 
Regulations had certain thresholds. To 
align the LODR Regulations and ICDR 
Regulations, the ICDR Amendment 
Regulations 2025 have introduced a 
concept of materiality in Paragraph 12 
of Part A of Schedule VI of the ICDR 
Regulations. Further, it requires
companies to disclose all criminal 
proceedings involving key managerial 
personnel and senior management of 
the issuer and actions by regulatory 
authorities and statutory authorities 
against key managerial personnel and 
senior management of the issue.
b. The ICDR Regulations requires issuers 
to appoint a compliance officer to 
redressal of monitor compliance of 
securities laws and for redressal of 
investors’ grievances. However, 
previously no specific qualifications to 
be a compliance officer were stipulated. 
The ICDR Amendment Regulations 
2025 aligns the qualification of a 
compliance officer with the LODR 
Regulations and now specifies that the 
compliance officer must be qualified to 
be a Company Secretary.

c. The ICDR Amendment Regulations 
2025 have aligned certain definitions 
such as associate, employee, financial 
year, securities law, etc. in ICDR 
Regulations with those in the LODR 
Regulations.
6. Rights issue
With an aim to streamline processes and 
offer greater flexibility, the ICDR 
Amendment Regulations 2025 have inter-
alia introduced the following amendments 
to the ICDR Regulations, related to rights 
issue:
a.
removal of the previous monetary 
threshold of INR50 crore for rights 
issue under Regulation 3(b). This 
implies that ICDR Regulations would 
be applicable to all rights issue 
irrespective of the issue size. 
b.
similar to QIPs, the draft letter of offer 
is required to be directly filed with 
stock exchanges for the purpose of 
seeking in-principal listing approvals 
under Regulation 71. The final Letter 
of Offer is then to be submitted to 
SEBI for information and 
dissemination. 
c.
permitting promoters and promoter 
group to renounce their rights 
entitlements to specific investors by 
giving additional disclosures about 
these specific investors and the 
promoter group under Regulation 84.
d.
under Regulation 74, sub-regulation 
(3) and the proviso related to 
reservation for employees along with 
rights issue has been omitted. 
e.
In Regulation 69, issuers are now 
directly responsible for preparing the 
draft letter of offer and letter of offer. 
The erstwhile requirement of 
appointing one or more merchant 
bankers and due diligence thereby, 
has been dispensed with. 
Further, SEBI has also issued a circular 
dated 11 March 2025 on faster rights issue 
with a flexibility of allotment to specific 
investor(s).
Next steps
In today’s dynamic and rapidly evolving 
market environment, regulatory adaptability 
and coherence are essential for sustaining 
investor confidence and market integrity. The 
SEBI ICDR Amendment Regulations 2025 aim 
at harmonising regulations with the LODR 
Regulations. This is a strategic step towards 
strengthening the capital market ecosystem in 
India as this initiative not only simplifies 
procedural requirements for market 
participants but also reflects SEBI’s ongoing 
commitment to enhancing transparency and 
promoting ease of doing business. Also, once 
a company is listed, it will primarily follow the 
LODR Regulations. The harmonisation of the 
ICDR Regulations with the LODR Regulations 
also ensures that there are no conflicting or 
redundant compliance requirements. This 
streamlining helps listed companies maintain 
consistent and efficient compliance practices, 
reducing the regulatory burden and enhancing 
transparency for investors.
By aligning regulatory provisions and reducing 
redundancies, SEBI is fostering a capital 
market that is more transparent, inclusive, and 
conducive to economic growth. These reforms 
contribute to building a more efficient, 
accessible, and investor-friendly ecosystem.

LODR Regulations for enhanced corporate governance of HVDLEs amended
The SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 
2025 (Amendments), introduce several 
significant changes aimed at enhancing 
corporate governance norms and compliance 
for listed entities, mainly in relation to High-
Value Debt Listed Entities (HVDLEs). The 
Amendments has also added a new Chapter 
VA for corporate governance norms applicable 
only to HVDLEs. The Amendments clarify that 
HVDLEs with other specified securities listed, 
shall continue to comply with the provisions of 
regulations 15 to 27 of the LODR Regulations. 
The key amendments include:
1. Threshold increase and sunset clause:
• The threshold value of outstanding listed 
non-convertible debt securities has been 
increased from INR500 crore to 
INR1,000 crore for an entity to be 
classified as HVDLE. Entities meeting 
this threshold must comply with additional 
corporate governance norms.
• A sunset clause has been introduced to 
state that the LODR Regulations will 
cease to apply to a HVDLE, after three 
consecutive years, from the time the 
value of outstanding debt remains below 
the specified threshold.
2. Corporate governance norms for 
HVDLEs:
• Board composition: HVDLEs must 
have an optimal mix of executive and 
non-executive directors, with at least 
one-woman director. Non-executive 
directors should constitute at least 50 per 
cent of the board.
• Independent directors: Specific 
criteria for the appointment and 
evaluation of independent directors, 
including limits on the number of 
directorships they can hold.
• Committees: In order to avoid 
constitution of multiple committees by 
HVDLEs, the Amendments provide 
certain flexibility to HVDLEs. The Board 
of Directors may choose that the 
functions of the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee (NRC) and 
Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee 
(SRC) may be discharged by the Board 
of Directors and a separate NRC or SRC 
may not be constituted. Similarly, the 
functions of the Risk Management 
Committee (RMC) may be discharged by 
audit committee or by the board of 
directors instead of constituting a 
separate RMC.
3. Related party transactions (RPTs):
• Enhanced disclosure and approval 
requirements for material RPTs. 
Transactions exceeding INR1,000 crore 
or 10 per cent of the annual consolidated 
turnover must be approved by the audit 
committee and require no-objection 
certificates from debenture trustees and 
debenture holders of listed debt 
securities (issued on or after 
1 April 2025).
• Guidelines to determine material 
transactions have been included 
• Approval requirements in relation to all 
related party transactions and 
subsequent material modifications are 
specified. Omnibus approvals granted 
basis policy on RPTs of HVDLEs, will be 
valid for a period not exceeding 1 year.

transactions and any cybersecurity 
incidents or breaches.

governance standards.

NFRA auditor-audit committee interaction series 
The National Financial Reporting Authority 
(NFRA) had launched Auditor-Audit 
Committee interaction series, focuses on 
enhancing communication between auditors 
and audit committees regarding various 
matters in order to improve audit quality and 
protect public interest. As part of these 
interactions, NFRA issued the following:
A. Series 2 on audit strategy and plan:
On 28 March 2025, NFRA published series 2 
that draws auditor’s attention to potential 
questions the Audit Committees/Board of 
Directors may ask auditors in respect of their 
audit strategy and audit plan. Several 
Standards on Auditing (SAs) impact the 
auditor's strategy and plan. SA 300, Planning 
an Audit of Financial Statements provides a 
framework for developing an audit strategy 
and plan, while SA 315, Identifying and 
Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement 
Through Understanding the Entity and its 
Environment and SA 330, The Auditor’s 
Responses to Assessed Risks address risk 
assessment and responses to assessed risks. 
This document lists potential questions that 
audit committees may ask auditors in relation 
to audit strategy and plan such as covering 
communication plans, compliance with 
independence norms, use of experts, and

Clarification on compliance officer’s position in listed entity
SEBI issued a circular on 1 April 2025, 
clarifying the position of the Compliance 
Officer (CO) in the organisation structure of 
the listed entity under Regulation 6 of the 
LODR Regulations. The SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
(Third Amendment Regulations), 2024 dated 
12 December 2024, required that a CO must 
be in whole-time employment of the listed 
entity, not more than one level below the 
board of directors, and designated as a Key 
Managerial Personnel. SEBI has now clarified 
that ‘one-level below the board’ refers to the 
position directly below the Managing Director 
or Whole-time Director(s) as per the 
organisation structure of the listed entity. 
If these positions do not exist, the CO should 
be one level below the Chief Executive Officer 
or the person heading day-to-day affairs of the 
listed company.

SEBI board meeting
On 24 March 2025, SEBI approved certain 
proposals to amend some provisions of the 
SEBI Regulations. Below are some key 
decisions from the SEBI board meeting:
1. Increased threshold for additional 
disclosure requirements for FPIs: As per 
SEBI circular dated 24 August 2023, FPIs 
(individually or as an investor group), 
holding more than INR25,000 crore of 
equity Assets Under Management (AUM) in 
Indian markets are required to disclose 
details of all entities (up to the level of 
natural person) holding any ownership, 
economic interest, or control, on a full look 
through basis, without any thresholds. This 
amendment aimed to increase the 
threshold for additional disclosure 
requirements for Foreign Portfolio Investors 
(FPIs) from INR25,000 crore to INR50,000 
crore of equity AUM in Indian markets. This 
change is in response to the doubling of 
cash equity market trading volumes since 
FY 2022-23, when these limits were set. 
Other disclosure threshold applicable to 
FPI holding more than 50 per cent of its 
equity AUM in a single corporate group 
remains unchanged.
2. Review of Regulation 17 (a) of SEBI 
(AIF) Regulations, 2012: Investments of 
category II AIFs in listed debt securities 
rated 'A' or below will be treated as akin to 
investments in unlisted securities for 
compliance with minimum investment 
conditions in unlisted securities.
3. Easing compliance for category II AIFs: 
Currently, these AIFs must hold a majority 
of their investments in unlisted securities. 
However, recent changes to LODR 
Regulations provide that entities issuing 
listed debt securities can only issue fresh 
debt in a listed form. This could reduce the 
availability of unlisted debt securities, 
complicating compliance with investment 
norms. To address this, the amendment 
provides that the investments of Category II 
AIFs in listed debt securities rated 'A' or 
below to be treated as investments in 
unlisted securities for purpose of 
compliance with minimum investment 
conditions in unlisted securities.
4. Amendments to SEBI (Merchant Bankers) 
Regulations, 1992, SEBI (Debenture 
Trustee) Regulations, 1993, and SEBI 
(Custodians) Regulations 1996 were 
deferred for further review.

Streamlining ESG disclosures and green credits
Following recommendations and public 
consultation, SEBI has revised provisions 
related to the assurance framework and ESG 
disclosures for the value chain and introduced 
new disclosure requirements for green credits. 
Following are the key updates:
• Green credits: Starting FY 2024-25, the 
BRSR includes a new leadership indicator 
requiring disclosures on green credits.
• Assessment or assurance: To streamline 
processes and reduce costs, listed entities 
can opt for either 'assessment' or 
'assurance' for BRSR Core and ESG 
disclosures beginning FY 2024-25.
• ESG disclosures for value chain: The 
requirement for value chain disclosures has 
been postponed by one year. 
Consequently, ESG disclosures for the 
value chain will be voluntary for the top 250 
listed entities (by market capitalisation) from 
FY 2025-26 and mandatory from FY 2026-
27. Reporting of previous year numbers will 
be voluntary for the first year of ESG value 
chain disclosures.
The assessment or assurance of these 
disclosures will be voluntary from FY 2026-
27.

Proposal to widen scope of fast track mergers
On 5 April 2025, the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs (MCA) via a draft notification, 
proposed an amendment to the Companies 
(Compromises, Arrangements and 
Amalgamations) Amendment Rules, 2016 
(CAA Rules), to broaden the scope of fast-
track mergers under Section 233 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (2013 Act). This 
amendment aims to streamline corporate 
restructuring and ease of doing business by 
extending the simplified merger procedures 
to more unlisted and low-debt companies.
Presently, Section 233 of the 2013 Act read 
with Rule 25(1A) of CAA Rules covers mergers
between following class of companies under 
the fast track merger scheme:
a. Merger between two or more small 
companies
b. Merger between a holding company and its 
wholly owned subsidiary
c. Merger between two or more startup 
companies
d. Merger between one or more startup 
company with one or more small company.
The draft suggests that a new set of 
companies should be covered by the fast track 
mergers under Section 233 of the 2013 Act 
which are as follows:
a. merger between unlisted companies (other 
than section 8 companies2) with borrowing 
from banks and financial institutions less 
than INR50 crore and have no default in 
repayment of such borrowings. Such 
companies are required to meet this criteria 
as on a day, not more than 30 days before 
the date of notice referred to in Section 
233(1)(a) of the 2013 Act.
b. merger between a holding company (listed 
or unlisted) and one or more of its unlisted 
subsidiary company/ companies (may or 
may not be a wholly owned subsidiary).
c. merger between subsidiaries of the same 
holding company where the transferor 
company is not listed.
d. merger of a foreign holding company, 
incorporated outside India, with its wholly 
owned subsidiary company being an Indian 
company incorporated in India.
The draft is open for public comments until 
5 May 2025.
(Source: MCA draft notification ‘MCA invites public 
comments on proposed amendment in the Rules to 
widen the scope of fast track mergers under Companies 
Act, 2013; dated 5 April 2025)
2.  Section 8 provides ‘Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Central Government that a person or an association of persons proposed to 
     be registered under this Act as a limited company -
a.
has in its objects the promotion of commerce, art, science, sports, education, research, social welfare, religion, charity, protection of 
environment or any such other object;
b.
intends to apply its profits, if any, or other income in promoting its objects; and
c.
intends to prohibit the payment of any dividend to its members , the Central Government may, by licence issued in such manner as 
may be prescribed, and on such conditions as it deems fit, allow that person or association of persons to be registered as a limited 
company under this section without the addition to its name of the word ’Limited’, or as the case may be, the words ‘Private Limited’ , 
and thereupon the Registrar shall, on application, in the prescribed form, register such person or association of persons as a company 
under this section.

Clarification on treatment of ROU assets
The RBI issued a notification clarifying the 
treatment of Right-of-Use (ROU) assets for 
computation of regulatory capital/owned funds. 
According to Indian Accounting Standard (Ind 
AS) 116, Leases are reflected on a lessee's 
balance sheet as a liability (obligation to make 
lease payments) and a related ROU asset. 
The notification applies to Non-Banking 
Financial Companies (NBFCs) and Asset 
Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) with an 
immediate effect.
Key points of the notification include:
• NBFCs and ARCs are not required to 
deduct ROU assets from owned fund, 
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital, or 
Tier 1 capital, provided the underlying 
leased asset is tangible. 
• ROU assets will be risk-weighted at 100 per 
cent, consistent with the risk weight 
historically applied to owned tangible assets.
These changes have been also incorporated in 
the following directions:
a. Core Investment Companies (Reserve 
Bank) Directions, 2016
b. Mortgage Guarantee Companies (Reserve 
Bank) Directions, 2016 and 
c. Master Direction - Standalone Primary 
Dealers (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016.

The amendments to SEBI (Mutual Funds) 
Regulations,1996 was carried out to facilitate 
ease of doing business for mutual funds, and 
to relax framework relating to ‘Alignment of 
interest of the Designated Employees of the 
Asset Management Companies (AMC) with 
the interest of the unitholders’ through two 
notifications dated 14 February 2025 and 
4 March 2025 respectively. Subsequently, 
SEBI has issued a circular on 21 March 2025 
in order to give effect to these amendments, 
by modifying certain provisions of the Master 
Circular dated 27 June 2024. Key 
amendments include:
• Investment requirements: Designated 
employees must invest a minimum 
percentage of their gross annual 
compensation (net of taxes and statutory 
contributions) in mutual fund schemes they 
oversee. The investment percentages vary 
based on compensation slabs and whether 
Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) 
are included.
• Liquid fund schemes: For employees 
managing liquid fund schemes, up to 75 per 
cent of required investments can be made 
in higher-risk schemes managed by the 
AMC.
• Lock-in period adjustments: Upon 
retirement at superannuation age, units will 
be released from lock-in except in close-
ended schemes. On resignation or 
retirement, lock-in period will be reduced to 
1 year from the end of the employment or 
the completion date of the 3-year lock-in, 
whichever is earlier. Post lock-in, units in 
open-ended schemes can be redeemed, 
subject to SEBI insider trading regulations 
and pre-clearance requirements.
• Disclosure and compliance: AMCs must 
disclose aggregate compensation invested 
in units for the designated employees on 
stock exchange websites quarterly within 15 
calendar days from end of each quarter. 
Additionally, violations of the code of 
conduct by designated employees will be 
reviewed by the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee (NRC) and in 
absence of NRC by the Board of Directors 
of the AMC which will then provide 
recommendations to SEBI for consideration, 
after approval from Trustees.
These amendments aim to strengthen the 
alignment of employee interests with those of 
investors, enhancing transparency and 
accountability within AMCs. The changes will 
be effective from 1 April 2025.

The RBI issued a notification on 
29 March 2025, revising the norms for 
government guaranteed Security Receipts 
(SRs) with an aim to provide a differentiated 
approach for SRs with sovereign guarantees, 
ensuring prudential treatment relating to 
valuation of such SRs. These revised norms 
apply to all commercial banks, co-operative 
banks, financial institutions, and NBFCs.
The treatment relating to valuation and 
provisioning is as follows:
1. If a loan is transferred to an Asset 
Reconstruction Company (ARC) for a value 
higher than the net book value (NBV), the 
excess provision can be reversed to the 
profit and loss account in year of sale if the 
sale consideration includes only cash and 
SRs guaranteed by the Government of 
India.
2. The non-cash component (SRs) must be 
deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 
1) capital, and no dividends can be paid 
from this component.
3. SRs will be valued periodically based on 
the Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the 
ARC, considering recovery ratings.
4. Unrealised gains from fair valuation of SRs 
must be deducted from CET 1 capital, and 
no dividends can be paid from these 
unrealised gains.
5. SRs outstanding after the government 
guarantee expires or is settled, will be 
valued at INR1.
6. If SRs are converted to other instruments 
as part of resolution, their valuation and 
provisioning will follow the Prudential 
Framework for Resolution of Stressed 
Assets dated 7 June 2019.
These provisions are effective immediately 
and apply to all existing and future 
investments involving SRs guaranteed by the 
Government of India.

SEBI clarification on SIF framework
SEBI issued a circular on 9 April 2025, 
providing clarifications stated below on the 
regulatory framework for Specialized 
Investment Funds (SIFs):
1. Interval investment strategies: The 
maturity provisions for securities in interval 
schemes, as outlined in the Master Circular 
for Mutual Funds dated 27 June 2024, will 
not apply to interval investment strategies 
under SIF.
2. Minimum investment threshold: The 
minimum investment threshold has been 
modified. An investor's aggregate 
investment across all SIF strategies at the 
Permanent Account Number (PAN) level 
must be at least INR10 lakh. This threshold 
does not apply to mandatory investments 
made by AMCs for designated employees.
This clarification aims to ensure consistent 
application of the SIF framework and protect 
investor interests and is effective immediately.

To promote ease of doing business and 
enhance the regulatory framework for 
Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) and 
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), SEBI 
has issued circulars on 28 March 2025 to 
amend the master circulars for InvITs and 
REITs respectively. The main amendments 
covered therein are as follows:
1. Lock-in provisions for preferential issue 
of units: The existing regulations provide 
that the sponsor and sponsor group of 
InvIT and REITs must hold a minimum of 
15 per cent of the total units for three years 
from the listing date in case of InvIT and 
from the date of trading approval in case of 
a REIT. The summary of the amendment is 
as follows:
a. InvITs: If the project manager is the 
sponsor or an associate, sponsors and 
sponsor groups are required to hold 15 
per cent of the units for three years from 
the listing date. Otherwise, 25 per cent 
of the units must be locked in for three 
years form the listing date. The 
remaining units are subject to a one 
year lock in period.
b. REITs: Sponsors and sponsor groups 
must retain at least 15 per cent of the 
total units for three years from the date 
of the initial offer listing. The updated 
requirements specify that 15 per cent of 
the units allotted to sponsors and 
sponsor groups will be locked in for three 
years from the date of trading approval, 
while the remaining units will be locked in 
for one year. 
2. Inter-se transfer of locked in units: In 
case of both InvIT and REITs locked-in 
units allotted under a preferential issue to a 
sponsor can be transferred among sponsor 
or sponsor group entities, subject to the 
condition that the original lock-in period 
shall continue with the transferee. Further 
the transferee will not be eligible to transfer 
such units till expiry of the original lock in 
period. In case of change in sponsor, 
transfer of lock in units will be allowed to 
the incoming sponsor or sponsor group 
provided the incoming sponsor shall 
continue to comply with minimum unit 
holding requirements
3. Guidelines for follow-on offer3: Follow-on 
offers have been introduced as a method 
for raising funds after the initial public offer 
for both InvITs and REITs. The provisions 
applicable to a public issue of units of an 
InvIT/REIT will also be applicable for follow-
on offers by them. The circular provides for 
the framework of follow on offer specifying 
therein various requirements such as 
application to be made to all stock 
exchanges on which units are listed for an 
in principal approval, mandatorily issuing 
units in dematerialised form, ensuring a 
minimum public unit holding of 25 per cent 
of the total outstanding units post-issue, 
adhering to specified timelines for the 
allotment and listing of units and it also 
includes a restriction on further issue of 
units in any form (public issue, rights issue 
preferential issue) by both InvIT and REIT 
during the period from date of filing of draft 
follow-on offer document to the listing of the 
units or refund of application monies as 
applicable.
4. Additional provisions applicable to InvIT 
and REITs: 
a. Provision for payment of interest under 
a follow-on offer in case of failure to allot 
or list units
b. Requirement to submit due-diligence 
certificate to SEBI along with the draft 
follow-on offer document.
These circulars are effective from 
28 March 2025.

The RBI amended below rates through a 
series of notifications issued on 9 April 2025, 
effective immediately:
1. Reduction in penal interest rate on CRR 
and SLR: RBI reduced the bank rate by 25 
basis points, from 6.50 per cent to 6.25 per 
cent. Consequently, RBI reduced all penal 
interest rates for banks in relation to 
shortfall to meet Cash Reserve Ratio 
(CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) 
requirements by RBI by 25 basis points. 
2. Reduction in Standing Liquidity Facility 
(SLF)4: RBI reduced the policy repo rate 
under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility 
(LAF)5 by 25 basis points, lowering it from 
6.25 per cent to 6.00 per cent. 
Consequently, the SLF provided to Primary 
Dealers (PDs), which offer collateralised 
liquidity support, will now be available at the 
revised repo rate of 6.00 per cent.
3. Reduction in standing deposit facility 
(SDF)6: Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) 
of the RBI has reduced the policy repo rate 
under the LAF by 25 basis points from 6.25 
per cent to 6 per cent. Consequently, the 
SDF rate is adjusted to 5.75 per cent and 
the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate is 
adjusted to 6.25 per cent.

Various rates amended by RBI to align with the monetary policy
4.
A Standing Liquidity Facility (SLF) is a program offered by the RBI to standalone primary dealers, providing them with additional funds at the 
prevailing repo rate. It's a collateralised facility used to address liquidity needs, especially for primary dealers. 
5.
 The Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) is a monetary policy tool used by central banks like the RBI to manage liquidity in the financial 
system. It allows banks to borrow funds from the central bank (repo) or lend excess funds to the central bank (reverse repo). This helps 
banks adjust their day-to-day liquidity needs and influences short-term interest rates. 
6.
 A Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) is a monetary policy tool used by central banks to absorb excess liquidity from the banking system. It 
allows banks to deposit their excess funds with the central bank without requiring collateral. Essentially, it's a mechanism to manage liquidity 
and control inflation by reducing the amount of money circulating in the economy

On 9 April 2025, RBI issued certain draft 
directions under the statement on 
developmental and regulatory policies which 
are open for comments until 12 May 2025. 
Following are various directions issued:
1. RBI (Co-Lending Arrangements) 
Directions, 2025: The document outlines a 
comprehensive framework for co-lending 
arrangements (CLAs) between REs to 
extend credit to borrowers. It was noticed 
that while there are separate guidelines 
covering some of these arrangements, for 
example digital lending, co-lending by 
banks with NBFCs to priority sector, as well 
as applicable guidelines on outsourcing of 
financial services, such regulatory 
frameworks do not cover all the possible 
categories of co-lending arrangements. 
Accordingly, a comprehensive market 
enabling draft framework has been 
prepared to specify the regulatory norms 
and guidance for all such CLAs, in general, 
while addressing certain prudential issues.
2. RBI (Securitisation of Stressed Assets) 
Directions, 2025: The draft outlines a 
framework for the securitisation of stressed 
assets by REs, including banks and 
NBFCs. It specifies eligibility criteria for 
assets, operational requirements, risk 
retention norms, and the roles of special 
purpose entities and resolution managers. 
The framework intends to enable 
securitisation of stressed assets through a 
market-based mechanism, in addition to 
the existing ARC route under the 
Securitisation and Reconstruction of 
Financial Assets and Enforcement of 
Security Interest Act, 2002. The draft also 
includes detailed guidelines on reporting, 
disclosures, and capital requirements for 
securitisation notes.
3. RBI (Non-Fund Based Credit Facilities) 
Directions, 2025: The draft outlines a 
regulatory framework for Non-Fund Based 
(NFB) credit exposures by banks and 
NBFCs. NFBs facilitate guarantees, letters 
of credit, co-acceptances, etc. and play a 
significant role in facilitating effective credit 
intermediation, besides enabling seamless 
business transactions, including trade 
transactions. The draft aims to harmonise 
regulations across REs. The revised 
guidelines include a review of instructions 
on issuance of partial credit enhancement 
by REs, with a view to, inter alia, 
broadening funding sources for 
infrastructure financing.
4. RBI (Lending Against Gold Collateral) 
Directions, 2025: Loans against the 
collateral of gold jewellery and ornaments 
are extended by REs for both consumption 
and income-generation purposes. 
Prudential and conduct related regulations 
for such loans have been issued from time 
to time and they vary for different 
categories of REs. The draft aims to 
harmonise regulations across REs. The 
draft proposes comprehensive prudential 
norms and conduct-related regulations, 
considering the risk-taking capabilities of 
various REs and addressing observed 
concerns. 
The drafts are open for comments until 
12 May 2025.

The International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board (IAASB) has issued the 
revised ISA 570 (Revised 2024), Going 
Concern. This revision, effective for audits of 
financial statements for periods beginning on 
or after 15 December 2026, aims to increase 
consistency in auditing practices and 
strengthen transparency through 
communications and auditor reporting on 
matters related to going concern in a 
consistent manner. Key changes include:
• Robust risk assessment procedures: 
Auditors must conduct timely and thorough 
risk assessments to identify events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on an entity's ability to continue as a going 
concern. The standard provides clarity by 
emphasising on such events or conditions 
on a gross basis – before considering 
management’s mitigation factors.
• Period of management’s assessment: 
Evaluation of management period for going 
concern assessment for at least twelve 
months from the date of financial statement 
approval. Auditors must evaluate 
management's assessment, considering 
potential biases, methods, assumptions, 
and data used.
• Enhanced transparency: Clearer 
communication in audit reports about 
responsibilities and work related to going 
concern and strengthened communications 
with governance and external parties. 
• Other aspects: There is also increased 
focus on adequacy of disclosures, clarity on 
relation with key audit matters, new 
guidance and examples for the evolving 
environment, strengthened documentation 
requirements for auditors and management 
representation requirements.

Strengthens Auditor Responsibilities for Going Concern 
through Revised Standard’; dated 9 April 2025)
Revised ISA 570 on going concern – IAASB 
IAASB issues guide for ISA for LCE
The International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board (IAASB) has released a
new ‘First-Time Implementation Guide – The 
International Standard on Auditing of Financial 
Statement of Less Complex Entities (ISA for 
LCE)’. This guide provides an overview of the 
standard's concepts, structure, and format, 
with step-by-step insights and examples to 
help practitioners implement the ISA 
effectively.
The guide is available on the IAASB website 
and complements other resources like an 
adoption guide, supplementary guidance, 
videos, and webinars. The guidance does not 
change the authoritative text of the ISA for LCE 
but helps in understanding and applying it.

First Notes
Related party transactions – Minimum information for review
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations) 
requires Related Party Transactions (RPTs) to be approved by the Audit Committee and, where applicable, by the shareholders. 
To facilitate a uniform approach and assist listed entities in complying with these requirements, SEBI issued a circular on 14 February 2025, 
specifying that listed entities should comply with the Industry Standards on ‘Minimum information to be provided for Review of the Audit Committee 
and Shareholders for approval of an RPT’ (RPT Industry Standards) effective 1 July 2025. The RPT Industry Standards have been formulated by the 
Industry Standards Forum (ISF), comprising representatives from three industry associations: Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of 
India (ASSOCHAM), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) in consultation 
with SEBI. 
This issue of First Notes aims to provide an overview of the Industry Standards issued for minimum requirements for the approval of RPTs.

Beyond the hype: Balancing speed, security and value
KPMG global 
tech report: Life 
sciences insights
Executive summary
At KPMG, we predict the future of life sciences will likely be shaped 
by tech-enabled connectivity, strategic uses of AI, and patient-centric 
supply chains.1 Globally, the life sciences sector is working on improving 
operations and creating new value by transforming digitally. But the 
innovation efforts of those in the sector face tough headwinds that 
include economic conditions, organizational performance, geopolitics 
and the competition for talent.2 
In a highly regulated sector where companies are often fragmented 
and siloed, transforming at scale can be difficult. By examining the 
perspectives of 123 life sciences technology leaders from around the 
world (based on a comprehensive survey3 of 2,450 technology function 
leaders, including chief digital officers, CIOs, CTOs, CISOs, chief AI 
officers and other executives from 26 countries, across 8 industries)  
this report provides valuable insights into how organizations are 
balancing speed, security and value. This content also compares life 
science tech function decision-making against previous year’s results, 
and a cross-sector average. KPMG life sciences technology specialists 
also weigh in on the findings and provide their own unique perspectives. 
Our research finds that life sciences tech leaders are racing to make 
the most of advanced technologies, but siloed, decentralized teams 
and historical underinvestment in data management are limiting the 
benefits. There should be a balance between keeping up, and applying 
a strategic approach to extracting genuine value from tech. It is essential 
to navigate the hype using evidence-based decisions, find solutions that 
are resilient, and scale new tools such as AI safely and responsibly.
To extend the value of its digital breakthroughs, the life sciences sector should rectify some of the 
weaknesses affecting its business models and technology decision-making processes

Key findings
Securing value despite struggling with the 
pace of change
From a technology perspective, the life sciences industry is facing 
some challenges in keeping pace with advancements. Sixty-one 
percent of life sciences technology leaders say they often find the 
pace of change difficult — seven percentage points more than the 
average across all of the sectors in our research.
Tech function leaders in last year’s research said that risk aversion 
was a root cause of this struggle to move fast enough, and they say 
the same this year: 63 percent say that risk aversion means their 
senior leadership teams move more slowly than their competitors 
when it comes to embracing new technology. Again, this is seven 
percentage points above the cross-sector average. This is also a 
missed opportunity for C-suite life sciences leaders. Another KPMG 
survey found that senior and line-level leaders in the healthcare and 
life sciences sectors said that having strong leadership and sponsors 
is a top factor in enterprise-wide transformation success.4

Executive summary
Securing value
Some life science leaders may be risk adverse in 
adopting new technologies or processes due to 
fear of failure or uncertainty. Another likely cause 
of this hesitancy relates to the sector’s regulatory 
complexities in that any new IT system or 
technology needs to comply with regulators’ GxP 
or ‘good practice’ principles that control the quality 
and compliance of products and processes. 
 
Dr. Jayne Goble 
Partner, IoT OT Cyber Security Services 
KPMG in the UK
Global life sciences companies are complex organizations. Often, 
their operations can be siloed because of a history of mergers and 
acquisitions, with different therapeutic divisions using different 
systems. To add to this complexity, the life sciences sector has 
long value chains that span phases including discovery, R&D, 
preclinical and clinical research, manufacturing, commercialization 
and post-market research. Life sciences companies are also at risk 
of being constrained by regulatory concerns and organizational 
complexities that force them to digitally innovate cautiously.
There is also concern about costs. Life sciences tech leaders 
are more likely than those in other sectors to say that hidden 
costs often disrupt their digital transformation plans. “In the 
past, organizations in the sector have been burned from throwing 
money at shiny new digital tools that just don’t achieve the 
expected return, because these projects encounter so many 
complexities along the way,” says Mike Krajecki, Partner, Advisory, 
KPMG Lighthouse Center of Excellence for Data and Technology, 
KPMG in the US. “So now they spend a lot more time upfront 
measuring potential value and de-risking the process.”  
Despite the concerns about life sciences company leadership being 
risk averse, tech leaders in the sector are being brave. Out of the 
eight industries surveyed, life sciences is the most likely to say that 
having the courage to strategically embrace emerging technologies 
is an essential attribute of thriving in a digital economy. The sector 
is also making progress in deriving value from digital innovation. Life 
sciences technology leaders say that investment in key technologies 
has improved profitability markedly in the last year.

Securing value
There is also evidence of an increase in tech maturity. In areas including 
XaaS technologies, modern delivery methods such as no code and low 
code, and VR/AR/XR and spatial computing, life sciences is one of the 
industry’s most likely to say they are taking a proactive approach and 
constantly evolving. 
“I think we are starting to see life sciences organizations tackling the 
challenges standing in the way of value,” says Krajecki. “For example, we 
are seeing a more centralized approach to technology investment, scaling 
successful projects across teams and regions.” But there is more work to do. 
Overall, only 56 percent of life sciences tech leaders say they are satisfied 
with the amount of value they are getting from their technology investments. 
This is 13 percentage points lower than the cross-sector average. 
Key recommendations
Examine their existing technology capabilities by conducting comprehensive 
assessments to identify strengths and weaknesses and determine future 
state capabilities.
To help support transformation at scale in fragmented and siloed organizations, 
life sciences companies should:
Develop enterprise-wide digital transformation strategies that seamlessly 
integrate technology aimed at capturing more value, improving business 
performance and increasing enterprise flexibility and agility.

Improving technology investment 
decision-making
To maximize the value of their digital transformation journeys, life 
sciences companies will likely need to enhance their due diligence 
on the likely returns from their investments — especially as the pace 
of their technology adoption accelerates. Compared with every other 
sector in the survey, in the next year life sciences is the industry that 
is most likely to be planning further investment in five of the nine 
technology categories considered: XaaS, quantum computing, edge 
computing, VR, AR and XR, and low code/no code. 
For now, the sector’s technology investment allocation process appears 
to be falling short. Life sciences tech leaders are 13 percentage points 
less likely than the cross-sector average to say that their organizational 
decision-making processes usually result in sound decisions that lead  
to valuable outcomes. The sector also significantly lags behind the  
cross-sector average on tech investment decision-making leading 
practices across the board (see adjacent chart). These tech leaders 
are less likely to follow clear and consistent processes, less likely to 
consider the needs of key stakeholder groups when investing, and less 
likely to use competitive benchmarks.

Investment decision making
Greater data maturity is one way to improve the quality of the sector’s digital transformation decisions. “Traditionally, 
pharma, med tech and life sciences have under invested in how they govern data,” says Mike Krajecki, Partner, 
Advisory, KPMG Lighthouse Center of Excellence for Data and Technology, KPMG in the US. “This, combined with 
siloed data between departments and divisions, has created a lack of shared standards and interoperability that 
makes it harder to achieve returns from digital technologies at an enterprise level.” 
The life sciences sector is doing better when it comes to data: more are now at a mature stage of adoption of      
real-time and predictive analytics, and strategies for monetizing data. But the sector is still behind others in overall 
data maturity. 
In life sciences there needs to be a renewed focus on establishing centralized data 
governance, data management and other capabilities that have often been federated 
to individual business teams. To derive value from data you need to have strong 
guardrails from the top.

KPMG in the US
To help improve technology investment decision-making, 
life sciences companies should:
Put a value stream-based lens on transformation strategies 
to identify technology solutions that help to increase the 
flow of value along the end-to-end value stream; connect 
the organization to its customers, employees, business 
partners and suppliers; and connect the silos among 
different divisions within companies and within functions 
such as the front, middle and back offices.
Improve their data maturity by developing the data 
strategies and governance models needed to translate 
large, complex data landscapes into real, actionable 
insights, and consider establishing enterprise-level data 
platforms or centralized repositories for organizational data 
across an array of functions and needs.
Key 
recommendations
Life sciences does, however, show leadership qualities in being even-handed with spreading its attention across legacy 
systems and new tech. It performs above the cross-sector average on the number of tech leaders who plan to balance 
advanced technology and existing tech systems: 40 percent plan to keep this approach, which is 14 percentage points 
above the cross-sector average. 
Life sciences tech leaders recognize that unaddressed technology debt holds back innovation. They rank this as one of 
their top three most pressing digital transformation challenges, which is in line with the leader group of high-performing 
organizations in our global research.

Moving quickly on AI
Life sciences tech leaders are moving quickly to refine their AI policies and approaches as Generative AI sweeps the business world. AI has 
been embedded in various life sciences processes for at least the past decade — R&D innovation cycles, for instance — and that experience 
is paying off. It is one of the top three sectors in our survey for maturity of AI adoption: 34 percent of tech leaders now use AI at scale and 
are achieving returns on their investments.
“AI has increased the speed and volume of R&D activities in life sciences,” says Dr. Jayne Goble, Partner, IoT OT Cyber Security Services, 
KPMG in the UK. “Which is likely to lead to new therapies being developed faster and more inexpensively in the future.” From a patient 
perspective, the Harvard School for Public Health projects a 50 percent reduction in treatment costs and a 40 percent improvement in health 
outcomes when using AI for diagnosis.5 
AI also plays a crucial role in the sector’s ability to transform. Life sciences is the sector that is most likely to see red teaming exercises 
to verify AI guardrails as the top way to adapt its digital transformation strategies to evolving market risks and trends. Concerns about 
compliance, intellectual property loss and the possibility of flawed data sets will likely mean that many life sciences firms may limit their 
Generative AI use to creating operational efficiencies in back-office functions. These functions include finance, compliance and clinical trials 
management, as well as front-office areas such as sales and marketing. 
One trend across all sectors is prioritizing a decentralized approach to finding new use cases for AI, and almost half of life sciences tech 
leaders (46 percent) say they are using this “democratized experimentation.” This is a greater proportion than in any other sector surveyed. 
This will change as the use of AI scales up — particularly because of governance, trust and cyber security concerns. 
Life sciences is more likely than other sectors to plan to centralize its approach once it has reached a critical mass of ideas. Looking ahead, 
73 percent of leaders in the sector expect AI to revolutionize industry practices, significantly enhancing efficiency and creating new business 
models. There are also exciting opportunities for further AI deployments in life sciences, including in drug discovery and the potential to 
tackle some of the sector’s regulatory workload.

Adopt policies and practices so that they can responsibly 
and confidently deploy AI enterprise-wide as scrutiny and 
regulation of AI increases.
Alleviate workforce concerns by equipping staff with 
tools that can enhance their work today, while offering 
development opportunities such as reskilling or upskilling 
to prepare for the future.
When it comes to AI and workforces, it’s not only tech function leaders who have concerns. The 2024 KPMG Life Sciences 
CEO Outlook found that CEOs in the sector have clear concerns about their organizations’ readiness to take on new forms 
of AI. In this survey, only 37 percent thought their companies had the right skills to fully make the most of the technology.6

Filling cyber risk gaps
Our research finds that tech function leaders in the life sciences sector intend to make targeted 
improvements to data infrastructure and competencies, including data accessibility, interoperability and 
insight identification. This investment is likely to increase the maturity of data analytics and support the 
roll-out of more AI initiatives. But the sector should stay mindful of risk: it is among the least likely sectors 
in our survey to say that improving data security (protecting the data stored by organizations through the 
security of systems, standards and governance processes) is a top data priority for the next 12 months.
As demonstrated in the KPMG global tech report 2024, having an end-to-end security mindset is a 
hallmark of a digital leader. The research found that risk and cyber security metrics are some of the most 
important performance indicators for measuring the value of technologies (e.g. failure rate, compliance 
violation incidents).7 But the life sciences sector is six percentage points more likely than the cross-sector 
average to admit they lack confidence in using these metrics. 
Sixty-one percent of life sciences tech leaders say that cyber security is often treated as a box-ticking exercise 
in staff training, while 59 percent of life sciences tech leaders say cyber security is typically involved at the 
earliest planning stage of new projects. This lags 13 percentage points behind the cross-sector average. 
In life sciences, cyber security and privacy concerns are among the factors seen as most likely to slow down 
transformation programs. This is in line with the cross-sector average. And when it comes to security, a few 
delays could be a sacrifice worth making. But addressing security and privacy by design upfront will likely take 
less time than having to retrofit protections later on.

These findings are not surprising as security within life sciences has historically been about infrastructure, protecting 
processes, systems and people. Some early movers in the sector have begun to take a more comprehensive approach 
to protecting infrastructure, data and their broader ecosystems.
At KPMG, we are seeing several trends that are causing some life sciences organizations 
to move in protecting their ever-expanding digital ecosystems. These trends include cyber 
criminals using AI and machine learning to create continuously evolving ransomware, 
and the need to track and secure an explosion of BYOD and corporate-owned devices. 
However, one of the most significant trends affecting the sector now is R&D and 
manufacturing approaches that combine traditional methods with advanced technologies 
such as AI, 4D printing, digital twins and microrobots.

To help fill in cyber risk gaps, life science companies 
should:
Key 
recommendations
Reframe the way cyber security is viewed, rather than a 
factor that slows down transformation; cyber security can be 
a key driver of growth and resilience, as well as customer, 
stakeholder and employee trust.
Adopt more comprehensive approaches to protecting 
infrastructure, data and ecosystems.
Integrate AI and machine learning into cyber security solutions 
to enhance system efficiency and enable predictive analysis, 
and utilize cloud platforms to significantly enhance monitoring 
and alerting capabilities.
Enact robust backup and recovery strategies, and tailored 
education programs that bring cyber security to the forefront 
of staff and stakeholder minds.
The very nature of how life sciences companies function also contributes to significant endpoint complexity. To develop 
new medicines and therapies, companies in the sector collaborate with partners, third-party vendors, research institutions 
and clinicians at clinical trial sites. In the coming year, Goble predicts zero trust cyber security approaches will continue to 
gain popularity. This approach enables organizations to fortify security posture by being proactive in safeguarding systems 
and data against insider threats, external breaches, and lateral movement within networks.

sciences insights
Executive summary
At KPMG, we predict the future of life sciences will likely be shaped 
by tech-enabled connectivity, strategic uses of AI, and patient-centric 
supply chains.1 Globally, the life sciences sector is working on improving 
operations and creating new value by transforming digitally. But the 
innovation efforts of those in the sector face tough headwinds that 
include economic conditions, organizational performance, geopolitics 
and the competition for talent.2 
In a highly regulated sector where companies are often fragmented 
and siloed, transforming at scale can be difficult. By examining the 
perspectives of 123 life sciences technology leaders from around the 
world (based on a comprehensive survey3 of 2,450 technology function 
leaders, including chief digital officers, CIOs, CTOs, CISOs, chief AI 
officers and other executives from 26 countries, across 8 industries)  
this report provides valuable insights into how organizations are 
balancing speed, security and value. This content also compares life 
science tech function decision-making against previous year’s results, 
and a cross-sector average. KPMG life sciences technology specialists 
also weigh in on the findings and provide their own unique perspectives. 
Our research finds that life sciences tech leaders are racing to make 
the most of advanced technologies, but siloed, decentralized teams 
and historical underinvestment in data management are limiting the 
benefits. There should be a balance between keeping up, and applying 
a strategic approach to extracting genuine value from tech. It is essential 
to navigate the hype using evidence-based decisions, find solutions that 
are resilient, and scale new tools such as AI safely and responsibly.
To extend the value of its digital breakthroughs, the life sciences sector should rectify some of the 
weaknesses affecting its business models and technology decision-making processes

Key findings
Securing value despite struggling with the 
pace of change
From a technology perspective, the life sciences industry is facing 
some challenges in keeping pace with advancements. Sixty-one 
percent of life sciences technology leaders say they often find the 
pace of change difficult — seven percentage points more than the 
average across all of the sectors in our research.
Tech function leaders in last year’s research said that risk aversion 
was a root cause of this struggle to move fast enough, and they say 
the same this year: 63 percent say that risk aversion means their 
senior leadership teams move more slowly than their competitors 
when it comes to embracing new technology. Again, this is seven 
percentage points above the cross-sector average. This is also a 
missed opportunity for C-suite life sciences leaders. Another KPMG 
survey found that senior and line-level leaders in the healthcare and 
life sciences sectors said that having strong leadership and sponsors 
is a top factor in enterprise-wide transformation success.4

Executive summary
Securing value
Some life science leaders may be risk adverse in 
adopting new technologies or processes due to 
fear of failure or uncertainty. Another likely cause 
of this hesitancy relates to the sector’s regulatory 
complexities in that any new IT system or 
technology needs to comply with regulators’ GxP 
or ‘good practice’ principles that control the quality 
and compliance of products and processes. 
 
Dr. Jayne Goble 
Partner, IoT OT Cyber Security Services 
KPMG in the UK
Global life sciences companies are complex organizations. Often, 
their operations can be siloed because of a history of mergers and 
acquisitions, with different therapeutic divisions using different 
systems. To add to this complexity, the life sciences sector has 
long value chains that span phases including discovery, R&D, 
preclinical and clinical research, manufacturing, commercialization 
and post-market research. Life sciences companies are also at risk 
of being constrained by regulatory concerns and organizational 
complexities that force them to digitally innovate cautiously.
There is also concern about costs. Life sciences tech leaders 
are more likely than those in other sectors to say that hidden 
costs often disrupt their digital transformation plans. “In the 
past, organizations in the sector have been burned from throwing 
money at shiny new digital tools that just don’t achieve the 
expected return, because these projects encounter so many 
complexities along the way,” says Mike Krajecki, Partner, Advisory, 
KPMG Lighthouse Center of Excellence for Data and Technology, 
KPMG in the US. “So now they spend a lot more time upfront 
measuring potential value and de-risking the process.”  
Despite the concerns about life sciences company leadership being 
risk averse, tech leaders in the sector are being brave. Out of the 
eight industries surveyed, life sciences is the most likely to say that 
having the courage to strategically embrace emerging technologies 
is an essential attribute of thriving in a digital economy. The sector 
is also making progress in deriving value from digital innovation. Life 
sciences technology leaders say that investment in key technologies 
has improved profitability markedly in the last year.

Securing value
There is also evidence of an increase in tech maturity. In areas including 
XaaS technologies, modern delivery methods such as no code and low 
code, and VR/AR/XR and spatial computing, life sciences is one of the 
industry’s most likely to say they are taking a proactive approach and 
constantly evolving. 
“I think we are starting to see life sciences organizations tackling the 
challenges standing in the way of value,” says Krajecki. “For example, we 
are seeing a more centralized approach to technology investment, scaling 
successful projects across teams and regions.” But there is more work to do. 
Overall, only 56 percent of life sciences tech leaders say they are satisfied 
with the amount of value they are getting from their technology investments. 
This is 13 percentage points lower than the cross-sector average. 
Key recommendations
Examine their existing technology capabilities by conducting comprehensive 
assessments to identify strengths and weaknesses and determine future 
state capabilities.
To help support transformation at scale in fragmented and siloed organizations, 
life sciences companies should:
Develop enterprise-wide digital transformation strategies that seamlessly 
integrate technology aimed at capturing more value, improving business 
performance and increasing enterprise flexibility and agility.

Improving technology investment 
decision-making
To maximize the value of their digital transformation journeys, life 
sciences companies will likely need to enhance their due diligence 
on the likely returns from their investments — especially as the pace 
of their technology adoption accelerates. Compared with every other 
sector in the survey, in the next year life sciences is the industry that 
is most likely to be planning further investment in five of the nine 
technology categories considered: XaaS, quantum computing, edge 
computing, VR, AR and XR, and low code/no code. 
For now, the sector’s technology investment allocation process appears 
to be falling short. Life sciences tech leaders are 13 percentage points 
less likely than the cross-sector average to say that their organizational 
decision-making processes usually result in sound decisions that lead  
to valuable outcomes. The sector also significantly lags behind the  
cross-sector average on tech investment decision-making leading 
practices across the board (see adjacent chart). These tech leaders 
are less likely to follow clear and consistent processes, less likely to 
consider the needs of key stakeholder groups when investing, and less 
likely to use competitive benchmarks.

Investment decision making
Greater data maturity is one way to improve the quality of the sector’s digital transformation decisions. “Traditionally, 
pharma, med tech and life sciences have under invested in how they govern data,” says Mike Krajecki, Partner, 
Advisory, KPMG Lighthouse Center of Excellence for Data and Technology, KPMG in the US. “This, combined with 
siloed data between departments and divisions, has created a lack of shared standards and interoperability that 
makes it harder to achieve returns from digital technologies at an enterprise level.” 
The life sciences sector is doing better when it comes to data: more are now at a mature stage of adoption of      
real-time and predictive analytics, and strategies for monetizing data. But the sector is still behind others in overall 
data maturity. 
In life sciences there needs to be a renewed focus on establishing centralized data 
governance, data management and other capabilities that have often been federated 
to individual business teams. To derive value from data you need to have strong 
guardrails from the top. 
  
Mike Krajecki 
Partner, Advisory 
KPMG Lighthouse Center of Excellence for Data and Technology 
KPMG in the US
To help improve technology investment decision-making, 
life sciences companies should:
Put a value stream-based lens on transformation strategies 
to identify technology solutions that help to increase the 
flow of value along the end-to-end value stream; connect 
the organization to its customers, employees, business 
partners and suppliers; and connect the silos among 
different divisions within companies and within functions 
such as the front, middle and back offices.
Improve their data maturity by developing the data 
strategies and governance models needed to translate 
large, complex data landscapes into real, actionable 
insights, and consider establishing enterprise-level data 
platforms or centralized repositories for organizational data 
across an array of functions and needs.
Key 
recommendations
Life sciences does, however, show leadership qualities in being even-handed with spreading its attention across legacy 
systems and new tech. It performs above the cross-sector average on the number of tech leaders who plan to balance 
advanced technology and existing tech systems: 40 percent plan to keep this approach, which is 14 percentage points 
above the cross-sector average. 
Life sciences tech leaders recognize that unaddressed technology debt holds back innovation. They rank this as one of 
their top three most pressing digital transformation challenges, which is in line with the leader group of high-performing 
organizations in our global research.

Moving quickly on AI
Life sciences tech leaders are moving quickly to refine their AI policies and approaches as Generative AI sweeps the business world. AI has 
been embedded in various life sciences processes for at least the past decade — R&D innovation cycles, for instance — and that experience 
is paying off. It is one of the top three sectors in our survey for maturity of AI adoption: 34 percent of tech leaders now use AI at scale and 
are achieving returns on their investments.
“AI has increased the speed and volume of R&D activities in life sciences,” says Dr. Jayne Goble, Partner, IoT OT Cyber Security Services, 
KPMG in the UK. “Which is likely to lead to new therapies being developed faster and more inexpensively in the future.” From a patient 
perspective, the Harvard School for Public Health projects a 50 percent reduction in treatment costs and a 40 percent improvement in health 
outcomes when using AI for diagnosis.5 
AI also plays a crucial role in the sector’s ability to transform. Life sciences is the sector that is most likely to see red teaming exercises 
to verify AI guardrails as the top way to adapt its digital transformation strategies to evolving market risks and trends. Concerns about 
compliance, intellectual property loss and the possibility of flawed data sets will likely mean that many life sciences firms may limit their 
Generative AI use to creating operational efficiencies in back-office functions. These functions include finance, compliance and clinical trials 
management, as well as front-office areas such as sales and marketing. 
One trend across all sectors is prioritizing a decentralized approach to finding new use cases for AI, and almost half of life sciences tech 
leaders (46 percent) say they are using this “democratized experimentation.” This is a greater proportion than in any other sector surveyed. 
This will change as the use of AI scales up — particularly because of governance, trust and cyber security concerns. 
Life sciences is more likely than other sectors to plan to centralize its approach once it has reached a critical mass of ideas. Looking ahead, 
73 percent of leaders in the sector expect AI to revolutionize industry practices, significantly enhancing efficiency and creating new business 
models. There are also exciting opportunities for further AI deployments in life sciences, including in drug discovery and the potential to 
tackle some of the sector’s regulatory workload.

In this survey, life sciences tech leaders also share views about AI’s ability to reshape the industry in the future. 
In life sciences, AI in the next decade will:
Adopt policies and practices so that they can responsibly 
and confidently deploy AI enterprise-wide as scrutiny and 
regulation of AI increases.
Alleviate workforce concerns by equipping staff with 
tools that can enhance their work today, while offering 
development opportunities such as reskilling or upskilling 
to prepare for the future.
When it comes to AI and workforces, it’s not only tech function leaders who have concerns. The 2024 KPMG Life Sciences 
CEO Outlook found that CEOs in the sector have clear concerns about their organizations’ readiness to take on new forms 
of AI. In this survey, only 37 percent thought their companies had the right skills to fully make the most of the technology.6

Executive summary
Moving quickly on AI
Filling cyber risk gaps
Our research finds that tech function leaders in the life sciences sector intend to make targeted 
improvements to data infrastructure and competencies, including data accessibility, interoperability and 
insight identification. This investment is likely to increase the maturity of data analytics and support the 
roll-out of more AI initiatives. But the sector should stay mindful of risk: it is among the least likely sectors 
in our survey to say that improving data security (protecting the data stored by organizations through the 
security of systems, standards and governance processes) is a top data priority for the next 12 months.
As demonstrated in the KPMG global tech report 2024, having an end-to-end security mindset is a 
hallmark of a digital leader. The research found that risk and cyber security metrics are some of the most 
important performance indicators for measuring the value of technologies (e.g. failure rate, compliance 
violation incidents).7 But the life sciences sector is six percentage points more likely than the cross-sector 
average to admit they lack confidence in using these metrics. 
Sixty-one percent of life sciences tech leaders say that cyber security is often treated as a box-ticking exercise 
in staff training, while 59 percent of life sciences tech leaders say cyber security is typically involved at the 
earliest planning stage of new projects. This lags 13 percentage points behind the cross-sector average. 
In life sciences, cyber security and privacy concerns are among the factors seen as most likely to slow down 
transformation programs. This is in line with the cross-sector average. And when it comes to security, a few 
delays could be a sacrifice worth making. But addressing security and privacy by design upfront will likely take 
less time than having to retrofit protections later on.

Executive summary
Filling cyber risk gaps
These findings are not surprising as security within life sciences has historically been about infrastructure, protecting 
processes, systems and people. Some early movers in the sector have begun to take a more comprehensive approach 
to protecting infrastructure, data and their broader ecosystems.
At KPMG, we are seeing several trends that are causing some life sciences organizations 
to move in protecting their ever-expanding digital ecosystems. These trends include cyber 
criminals using AI and machine learning to create continuously evolving ransomware, 
and the need to track and secure an explosion of BYOD and corporate-owned devices. 
However, one of the most significant trends affecting the sector now is R&D and 
manufacturing approaches that combine traditional methods with advanced technologies 
such as AI, 4D printing, digital twins and microrobots.

To help fill in cyber risk gaps, life science companies 
should:
Key 
recommendations
Reframe the way cyber security is viewed, rather than a 
factor that slows down transformation; cyber security can be 
a key driver of growth and resilience, as well as customer, 
stakeholder and employee trust.
Adopt more comprehensive approaches to protecting 
infrastructure, data and ecosystems.
Integrate AI and machine learning into cyber security solutions 
to enhance system efficiency and enable predictive analysis, 
and utilize cloud platforms to significantly enhance monitoring 
and alerting capabilities.
Enact robust backup and recovery strategies, and tailored 
education programs that bring cyber security to the forefront 
of staff and stakeholder minds.
The very nature of how life sciences companies function also contributes to significant endpoint complexity. To develop 
new medicines and therapies, companies in the sector collaborate with partners, third-party vendors, research institutions 
and clinicians at clinical trial sites. In the coming year, Goble predicts zero trust cyber security approaches will continue to 
gain popularity. This approach enables organizations to fortify security posture by being proactive in safeguarding systems 
and data against insider threats, external breaches, and lateral movement within networks.

To address these challenges, KPMG introduces the three phases of AI value — a framework designed to guide insurers through the AI adoption journey. This phased approach provides a structured roadmap, helping insurers prioritize investments, align initiatives with business goals, and position themselves effectively in the age of AI in insurance.
The Enable phase focuses on enabling people and building AI foundations. Organisations appoint a responsible executive, create an AI strategy, identify high-value use cases, boost AI literacy, align with regulations and establish ethical guardrails. AI pilots are launched across functions, while cloud platforms and pre-trained models are leveraged with minimal customisation.
The Embed phase integrates AI into workflows, products, services, value streams, robotics, and wearables, delivering greater value. A senior leader drives enterprise-wide workforce redesign, re-skilling and change, embedding AI into operating models with a focus on ethics, trust and security. AI agents and diverse models are deployed, supported by cloud and legacy tech modernisation, while enterprise-wide data enhances operations.
The Evolve phase evolves business models and ecosystems, using AI and frontier technologies like quantum computing and blockchain to solve large sector-wide challenges. AI orchestrates seamless value across enterprises and partners. Emphasizing ethics and trust with real-time security, this phase uplifts human potential with broad and deep workforce training, fostering a creative, innovative and value-driven future.
This research outlines a comprehensive blueprint for AI in insurance, helping insurers chart a path towards unlocking AI’s immense value.

Intelligent insurance: A blueprint for creating value through AI-driven transformation | 2
AI has been a part of the insurance industry for 
some time, but its adoption varies significantly 
based on insurance type, geography and the 
distinction between legacy insurers and insurtech 
disruptors. The emergence of generative AI, along 
with the next wave of autonomous and agentic AI 
systems, is unlocking entirely new possibilities for 
innovation across the sector. 
However, while some insurers are doubling down on AI 
investment to drive competitive advantage, others remain 
cautious, either due to regulatory concerns, legacy 
constraints, or uncertainty about AI’s long-term impact 
on their business models. This growing divide between 
AI leaders and more conservative adopters will shape the 
future trajectory of AI-driven transformation in insurance. 
AI adoption in life and non-life insurance for example 
differs considerably. Non-life insurers, dealing with high-
frequency claims in areas like auto and home insurance, 
have been using AI primarily for “back office” functions 
such as fraud detection, real-time risk assessment, 
automated claims processing and dynamic pricing. 
Their focus is on speed and operational efficiency, using 
structured external data such as telematics, Internet of 
things (IoT) and geospatial risk analysis. 
Foreword
AI is more than a technology investment for insurers — it is a transformative 
catalyst for redefining strategy, culture and operations. To fully unlock its 
potential, insurers must overcome inertia, embrace its possibilities and embed AI 
as a core driver of customer-centric and sustainable growth. 
Frank Pfaffenzeller 
Global Head of Insurance 
KPMG International
In contrast, life insurers managing long-term risks rely 
on biometric, medical and behavioral data to assess 
longevity and morbidity. AI is revolutionizing their 
underwriting processes by automating risk segmentation, 
integrating electronic health records and utilizing predictive 
analytics to refine policy pricing and assessment. Life 
insurers are integrating wearable data and wellness tracking 
to personalize policy pricing, rewarding healthy behaviors. 
AI is also improving claims automation by identifying 
fraud, analyzing death certificates and streamlining 
payouts through machine learning. Beyond underwriting 
and claims, AI is transforming longevity modeling and 
regulatory compliance in life insurance. Predictive 
analytics powered by AI can assess life expectancy, 
detect disease onset and optimize risk stratification, 
enabling insurers to refine pricing and payout structures. 
However, these solutions are often developed to solve a 
specific problem, but there is an opportunity to quickly 
adjust for wider use across the value chain. Gen AI and 
autonomous agents could empower organizations to 
enhance actuarial models, deliver personalized insurance 
cover or even increase the pace of insurance claims. 
But this will likely require an enterprise-wide view, 
breaking down organizational silos and using AI to 
monitor and mitigate its own risks. 
The insurers that embrace these challenges can be first 
to unlock AI’s transformative potential.

Introduction
At a glance
The rise of agentic, autonomous AI agents 
represents a fundamental shift in how insurance 
companies will operate, interact with customers 
and manage risk. Unlike traditional AI, which 
primarily enhances efficiency through automation 
and analytics, these next-generation agents can 
independently make decisions, execute complex 
tasks and continuously learn from interactions.
In insurance, this means policies that dynamically adjust 
based on real-time risk factors, claims that are processed 
and settled instantly without human intervention, and 
customer service that is hyper-personalized, context-
aware and available 24/7. 
The potential extends beyond operational 
improvements — agentic AI can redefine entire business 
models, enabling insurers to proactively mitigate risk, 
optimize pricing dynamically and provide unprecedented 
levels of customer engagement. 
These systems demand vast, high-quality data inputs, 
meaning insurers must invest in seamless data 
integration, real-time analytics and ethical AI governance. 
However, our research finds that insurers are still 
grappling with legacy operating models, technical debt 
and linear workflows, which are ill-equipped to handle 
the dynamic nature of AI innovation. Data is fragmented 
and often locked in functional specific systems. Rigid 
hierarchies and siloed functions create choke points 
that impede cross-functional collaboration, slow 
decision-making and limit agility.
Concerns about the rapid pace of technology 
development and caution over the AI-specific risks are 
causing hesitancy: 75 percent of insurance executives 
in our survey are concerned that investments they make 
now may be rendered obsolete in the near future. 
Insurers are also hesitating when it comes to build or 
buy decisions and worried that a vendor may release a 
better version. 
When coupled with concerns over the unknown risks, 
AI leaders are unsure where and when to focus their 
investments.

One of the considerations or 
challenges has been that AI 
technologies are invariably 
different. So, trying to narrow 
down on which one we might 
want to use, or which two we 
might want to use in the future 
is more challenging than we

Introduction
Insurance executives worry about premature AI investments amid rapid technological change. Here are four key considerations to guide no-regrets actions, 
helping insurers build flexibility and responsiveness to adapt to an AI future: 
Design an AI strategy that aligns 
with core competencies and 
unlocks value
Insurers should establish a bold vision for 
AI that aligns with their core strengths. 
This vision should guide a disruptive 
transformation road map that redefines how 
AI drives growth and innovation while holding 
teams accountable for results. Aligning AI 
deployments with strategic goals — such 
as improving fraud detection, streamlining 
underwriting and enhancing customer 
personalization — can help maximize ROI.
Build trust into the 
transformation road map
AI in insurance introduces unique risks 
that can undermine trust, meaning 
proactive risk management is critical 
from the outset. Insurers should address 
data privacy and security challenges, 
helping ensure compliance with financial 
regulations while protecting sensitive 
customer information.
Combatting algorithmic bias and 
adopting explainable AI systems that 
regulators, customers and internal 
stakeholders can trust are critical.
Create sustainable technology 
and data infrastructure for AI 
adoption
Data is a critical strategic asset and 
the foundation for all AI initiatives. 
Insurers should build a robust data 
governance framework, focusing on 
quality, integration and security, while 
also creating a foundation for long-term 
scalability. This includes investing 
in enterprise-grade AI infrastructure 
that can support high volumes of 
transactions, complex risk models and 
real-time decision-making. 
Build a culture that uses AI to 
uplift human potential
A multifaceted talent strategy that 
balances retention with upskilling should 
be a key priority. Academic institutions, 
fintech startups and innovation hubs can 
inject fresh perspectives and enhance 
workforce capabilities. Immersive AI 
training programs help to drive innovation 
in customer experiences and operational 
models, diversify hiring pipelines and 
enable transformative outcomes.​

findings
Current state
Insurance is an industry in transition. Historic investments in digital 
transformation are now being updated to incorporate AI, but data fragmentation 
caused by legacy operating models is inhibiting progress.
Organizational models are in transition
Insurance companies are changing to more customer-centric models, but progress 
remains uneven. Thirty-eight percent are still organized by independent functions with 
clear boundaries, while 44 percent are experimenting with hybrid models such as 
functional-agile combinations. 
Technology infrastructure in transition is evolving
Most insurers are still on the journey to modernizing their technology. While 60 percent 
have partially modernized their systems with cloud capabilities, only 18 percent have 
achieved a fully cloud-based infrastructure. 
Operating models inhibit consistent AI implementation
Operating models often hinder the consistent alignment of AI initiatives with business 
goals. Only 23 percent of insurers report operating models that effectively align AI 
with strategic objectives, while just 24 percent can achieve cross-functional alignment 
on AI projects. Furthermore, only 30 percent consistently integrate workflows across 
departments, creating silos that slow progress.
On-premises technology still dominates
Despite the push toward modernization, 59 percent of insurers rely on on-premises 
AI solutions and 55 percent are developing customized AI tools in-house. While these 
approaches offer control, they may lack the flexibility needed for scaling AI to meet 
future demands.
We have legacy infrastructure and applications. We 
have silos and we need to do more work with our 
data to ensure it is clean and accurate.

Research findings
Links are being made to synergistic 
technologies
Encouragingly, insurers are leveraging synergistic 
technologies to enhance AI’s impact. Fifty-seven 
percent have integrated AI with Robotic Process 
Automation (RPA), and 58 percent have data analytics 
platforms with AI capabilities.
AI is impacting key functions
Even with limited implementation, AI is beginning to 
deliver significant benefits across critical functions. 
Fifty-nine percent of insurers report a transformative 
impact on operations, while 58 percent see 
improvements in information technology (IT), 
supply chain and logistics.
Staff education on AI
Staff education remains foundational, with 61 percent of 
employees receiving AI training focused mainly on basic 
awareness. However, only 23 percent have undergone 
in-depth, comprehensive training, highlighting a need for 
more robust learning programs to equip employees for 
advanced AI applications.
Barriers to progress
For many insurance leaders, the primary concern is 
whether regulatory frameworks and risk management 
practices can evolve quickly enough to keep pace with 
advancing technology.
Building trust is a major concern—and priority
Trust in AI remains a significant hurdle for insurers. 
Forty-six percent of leaders have reservations about 
whether AI can be trusted while only 25 percent fully 
trust AI within their organizations. Eighty-two percent 
recognize the importance of establishing robust 
frameworks, policies and processes for regulatory 
compliance to ensure responsible AI implementation.
The AI vision is still being formed
While AI is a growing priority, alignment to a clear, 
strategic vision remains incomplete. Sixty-two percent of 
insurers are only partially aligned to an AI vision, and just 
19 percent have a fully integrated plan linking AI to goals 
at all levels. 
I think it’s the ethics of it, the accountability 
piece, understanding AI — the visibility and 
transparency of what your AI is doing…
When it goes wrong, a human needs to be 
accountable. Therefore, I think leaders need 
to understand ethics a lot more.

Research findings
Data readiness remains a challenge
Data management continues to be a critical barrier 
to scaling AI in insurance. Seventy-two percent of 
insurers identify data as their primary challenge, with 
only 34 percent achieving system-level data integration. 
Furthermore, just 13 percent have a data warehouse 
with real-time updates, and only 7 percent have fully 
automated data integration, highlighting significant gaps 
in data readiness for AI initiatives.
There is a conflict with sustainability 
commitments
The energy demands of AI are creating tension with 
insurers’ sustainability goals. Seventy-two percent 
struggle to balance AI’s increased energy usage with 
sustainability commitments, and 75 percent view meeting 
sustainability objectives as a higher strategic imperative 
than implementing AI. However, 79 percent have plans to 
mitigate AI’s energy demands, signaling awareness and a 
proactive approach to addressing it.
The rapid evolution of technology fuels inertia
The rapid pace of AI development is creating uncertainty 
among insurers, with 75 percent preferring to wait for 
the AI landscape to stabilize before making significant 
investments. Additionally, 58 percent feel overwhelmed 
by the volume of AI-related information and hype, and 
56 percent express concerns about the level of control AI 
technology providers might exert over their business.
You have outdated legacy systems and 
what is important, you also have data drift. 
What is data drift? You have silos, and every 
silo has its own database. And databases 
aren’t connected to each other. Every time 
the data is updated, we have data drift. 
Head of Strategy — Germany
Moving forward
These statistics highlight the complex challenges insurers 
face as they navigate AI adoption. Despite efforts to 
implement AI, the fragmented strategies and limited 
readiness illustrates the need for a more structured 
approach. 
Our research reveals that many respondents believe 
they are further along in their AI journey than their actual 
maturity levels indicate. This disconnect arises from 
being in the early stages of implementation, where 
initial gains mask the broader transformative potential 
of AI across the industry. To help insurers accurately 
assess their position in the AI development cycle and 
effectively prioritize initiatives, we introduce the three 
phases of the AI Value framework: Enable people, Embed 
AI in work and Evolve the enterprise to help insurers 
move from foundational capabilities to enterprise-wide 
transformation and ecosystem innovation. By 
addressing these barriers progressively, insurers can 
unlock AI’s transformative potential while mitigating 
risks. This framework helps ensure that AI becomes a 
sustainable and strategic enabler for long-term growth, 
competitiveness and resilience.

Enterprise
This layer orchestrates transformational change of the whole 
enterprise, starting with how AI can adjust strategy, business models 
and key objectives for the enterprise. It defines enterprise-wide 
operating model shifts, workforce evolution and risks and controls. 
This layer prioritizes AI transformation initiatives into a roadmap and 
runs a transformation office to help manage funding, track benefits 
and adjust priorities dynamically to help maximize the value delivered.
Functions
This layer drives AI-enabled transformation across business functions, 
prioritizing customer-facing value streams and end-to-end enabling 
processes and workflows, which enhance the flow of value such 
as underwriting, claims processing, fraud detection and customer 
engagement. AI applications, agents and robotics are embedded in 
the workflows. Functional operating model changes are delivered to 
realize potential benefits.
Foundations
This layer establishes the AI-first technology stack, including 
infrastructure, cloud and choices on chips. High-quality enterprise data 
needs to be curated, and diverse models are likely to be deployed to 
handle domain-specific AI. An increased focus on cybersecurity for AI is 
needed as well as a plan for other emerging technology, such as quantum.
Successfully implementing AI in an organization involves a strategic approach to 
building capability across foundational, functional and enterprise layers. Establishing 
a transformation management office is also crucial for aligning AI strategy, value 
orchestration and project delivery across all layers. The body coordinates initiatives, 
establishes standards and best practices, and facilitates cross-functional collaboration 
to drive accountability and enterprise-wide value.
Insurers have steadily transformed their operations with technologies like digital 
platforms, cloud computing and agile methodologies, integrating AI with new 
technologies like robotics and IoT. Now, new AI technologies and increased 
regulatory scrutiny are further transforming the industry. These trends demand 
that insurers navigate an environment where investing in technological 
innovation while maintaining compliance is critical.

Building the intelligent insurer
Our survey found that the path to value in AI is uneven 
across the organization, with innovation in some areas 
being easier or more worthwhile to pursue than in others. 
For example, some areas of the same organization will 
focus on foundational efficiencies (the first phase), other 
functions or value streams may be scaling AI for growth 
(the second phase), and a few may even be exploring 
transformative opportunities within ecosystems (the third 
phase). In fact, while no insurer we surveyed has fully 
achieved the third phase maturity, 13 percent of sector 
leaders report undertaking activities that demonstrate 
third phase characteristics.
As insurers progress through the three phases, their 
operating models will undergo a profound transformation, 
reshaping how they design products, engage with 
customers and position themselves in the broader 
ecosystem. They will shift from offering standardized 
products developed through lengthy and rigid approval 
processes to creating highly personalized, dynamic 
coverage tailored to individual customer needs in 
real time. AI will help insurers analyze vast amounts 
of customer data, such as lifestyle preferences, 
behaviors and risk profiles, allowing them to design and 
adjust products on demand, improving relevance and 
responsiveness. This flexibility will replace the traditional 
one-size-fits-all approach, delivering superior customer 
value and fostering loyalty. 
Simultaneously, insurers will evolve from being primarily 
product providers working through distribution partners, 
such as brokers and agents, to becoming integral 
players in larger, connected ecosystems. In this new 
role, they can collaborate seamlessly with ecosystem 
partners across industries — healthcare, mobility, 
retail and beyond — co-creating solutions that address 
comprehensive customer needs.

Building the intelligent insurer
Enable
The Enable phase focuses on enabling people and 
building AI foundations. Organizations appoint a 
responsible executive, create an AI strategy, identify 
high-value use cases, boost AI literacy, align with 
regulations and establish ethical guardrails. AI pilots 
are launched across functions, while cloud platforms 
and pre-trained models are leveraged with minimal 
customization.
Embed
The Embed phase delivers greater value by integrating 
AI into workflows. A senior leader drives enterprise-
wide workforce redesign, re-skilling and change, 
embedding AI into operating models with a focus 
on ethics, trust and security. AI agents and diverse 
models are deployed, supported by cloud and legacy 
tech modernization, while enterprise-wide data 
enhances operations.
Evolve
The Evolve phase evolves business models and 
ecosystems, using AI and frontier technologies like 
quantum computing and blockchain to solve large 
sector-wide challenges. AI can orchestrate seamless 
value across enterprises and partners. Emphasizing 
ethics and trust with real-time security, this phase 
uplifts human potential with broad and deep 
workforce training, fostering a creative, innovative 
and value-driven future.
A company may have a portfolio of initiatives aimed at any level (of the operating model) within each phase. The ratio of effort and investment across the phases will vary as the 
organization matures. Initially, most resources will focus on phase one, with a small effort to explore enterprise-wide transformation. Over time, as foundational efficiencies are 
realized, more effort is invested in phase two, while, with an eye on the future, long-term investments in phase three start to lay the groundwork for transformative innovation.  
This dynamic balancing act ensures insurers can achieve immediate results while setting themselves up in the right way for future success.
The journey to become an intelligent insurer
Effective AI-enabled transformation goes beyond technology implementation. By examining leading practice, we have 
identified that insurers can increase capability and value across three phases of AI transformation. 
This provides a structured yet flexible framework for navigating the complexities of AI adoption. It balances the need for 
short-term efficiency gains with the imperative to prepare for future growth and innovation. It helps insurers prioritize 
their efforts, allocate resources effectively, build capability and align their AI initiatives with short-term goals and 
long-term strategic objectives.

Phases of the 
AI journey
Focusing on maturity across the three phases — 
Enable, Embed and Evolve — is critical for 
sustained value creation. It requires increasing 
the maturity of the capabilities that are vital to 
the foundations, functions and enterprise layers 
simultaneously. 
At the enterprise layer, increased AI maturity involves 
orchestrating AI across functions to enable enterprise-
wide innovation and strategic alignment. Without a 
balanced focus on all three layers, organizations risk 
missing opportunities for transformation.
At the functions layer, AI should be embedded into 
key value streams, optimizing specific processes and 
creating improved outcomes, such as more compelling 
products and services, and more engaging, end-to-end 
employee and customer experiences.
At the foundations layer organizations should build up 
the new AI-first technology stack, through a process 
of technology modernization. Infrastructure, data, 
models and applications can all become optimized for 
delivery of AI.

The first phase: Enable 
Enable people 
with AI
There are frequent changes. So, we end up approaching 
this through an investment lens. This is going to get the 
ROI, so that’s where we’ve got to go. Instead of a future-
based thing, where we’re saying this is what our company 
will look like and so let’s get pulled into that future, it’s 
more like, let’s place our bets. 
Director of AI Strategy — US
1	 FT Adviser, “AI ushers in a new ear of fraud detection”, 23 January 2024
The Enable phase is about enabling people and establishing the foundations 
for AI adoption. At the enterprise level, this includes appointing a responsible 
executive, developing an AI strategy, identifying high-value use cases, 
increasing AI literacy, aligning with regulations and introducing ethical 
guardrails. At the function level, businesses pilot AI solutions across various 
areas, building skills, fostering innovation and learning from these initial 
implementations. At the foundation level, organizations leverage cloud 
platforms and pre-trained AI models from strategic providers with limited 
customization. This phase focuses on creating awareness, experimentation 
and alignment to ensure the organization is prepared for broader AI integration. 
Budget reduction is a major focus. The emphasis is on improving the 
productivity of the knowledge worker by outsourcing back-office functions 
to tools like robotic process automation. That will improve accuracy while 
reducing manual effort, enabling employees to focus on negotiating with 
suppliers and cutting costs.
With AI the key objective, the first phase is to identify low-hanging fruit 
where AI can deliver quick, measurable wins by automating routine tasks, 
streamlining workflows and reducing manual labor. In addition to chatbots, 
insurers are using AI to digitize and process paperwork, including policy 
applications. Insurers are also automating simple processes; in fact, AI’s ability 
to streamline claims processing while improving accuracy is one of the most 
immediate and tangible benefits for the industry.1 This can reduce settlement 
time from days or weeks to hours.

Claims processing automation: Claims processing has long 
been a pain point for both insurers and customers. AI-driven 
systems can improve processing time, reduce operational costs 
and increase customer satisfaction. At an industry leader based 
in the US, for example, machine learning algorithms can analyze 
photos of vehicle damage or natural disasters and immediately 
assess repair costs. 
Underwriting efficiency and precision: Traditionally, 
underwriting has been a highly manual process that 
relies heavily on historical data and actuarial science. AI is 
transforming this process by introducing predictive modeling 
and machine learning algorithms that can assess risk with 
far greater precision and speed. These technologies allow 
underwriters to analyze a broader range of data points in 
real time, including social media activity, environmental data and 
even satellite imagery.
Fraud detection: According to Insurance Europe, fraud costs 
insurers some US$14 billion a year — it is a pressing and 
insidious problem. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of 
data to identify potential fraudulent claims faster and more 
accurately than manual processes, reducing fraud-related 
losses and boosting overall profitability.

The second phase: Embed 
Embedding AI in 
the flow of work
The Embed phase integrates AI into end-to-end workflows, products, 
services and value streams, transforming how work is performed 
across the enterprise and delivering greater value. AI enables large 
teams to handle complex tasks and enhances efficiency. A senior 
leader oversees enterprise-wide change, setting strategic goals and 
embedding AI into operating models, robotics and wearable devices. 
This phase emphasizes ethics, inclusion, safety, security and trust. 
AI agents, along with diverse models (large, small, open, closed and 
domain-specific), are embedded into workflows, supported by data 
from various sources. Infrastructure combines cloud resources with 
on-premises GPUs, with a strong focus on security.
While many processes may still be in the first phase, insurers can 
begin to explore how AI can be used for value creation. In this phase, 
AI is not just a tool for cost savings; it becomes central to driving 
business growth, improving the customer experience, generating 
new revenue streams and improving the productivity of entire teams. 
As AI becomes more deeply integrated into core functions, insurance 
operating models are being redesigned to streamline end-to-end 
workflows and enhance customer outcomes. This transformation 
shifts the focus from traditional, product-centric structures (e.g. auto, 
home or life insurance) to value streams that cut across products and 
functions and address the holistic needs of the customer.
Customers are being provided with more personalized, 
more precisely priced products, which satisfy their needs 
better than in the past. Personalization is a major part 
of customer benefits, leading to customer satisfaction, 
customer loyalty and willingness to buy our products rather 
than competitors.

These value streams cut across functions, such as marketing, underwriting and customer 
service, to focus on holistic customer outcomes. With advanced analytics and machine 
learning, insurers can analyze vast amounts of customer data to understand individual 
preferences, behaviors and risk profiles. This enables the creation of tailored policies that 
meet specific customer needs, replacing traditional one-size-fits-all offerings. 
Shared data platforms and AI-driven insights that strengthen collaboration between business 
units make this possible, while AI-powered tools empower employees to take on higher-value 
advisory roles. Key metrics of success shift from cost reduction alone to include measures of 
customer satisfaction, cross-sell effectiveness and speed-to-market for new services.
AI-enhanced customer journeys: AI can be used to analyze 
customer behavior and predict needs, allowing insurers to offer 
personalized products and services at the right moment. For example, 
using machine learning models, insurers can anticipate life events like 
marriage or home purchases and proactively offer relevant insurance 
products to customers.
Dynamic risk modeling: In this phase, AI enables real-time risk 
assessment by incorporating dynamic data sources, such as Internet-
of-things (IoT) data or behavioral insights, to provide more precise risk 
modeling and pricing. 
Data privacy: Advanced AI algorithms can detect and classify 
personal data in real time, ensuring that it is securely stored and 
accessed only by authorized personnel. AI-driven tools can also 
monitor for unusual activity, flagging potential breaches or compliance 
risks early. 
Autonomous customer engagement: Agentic AI in a redesigned 
value chain enables the creation of tailored property and 
casualty (P&C) insurance products during customer interactions, 
replacing standard, limited options with highly personalized coverage. 
An AI-powered agent or avatar, trained in regulations and company 
policies, configures bespoke insurance solutions based on the 
customer’s needs and risk profile, seamlessly integrating risk 
acceptance, compliance and pricing models in real time.

Second phase
Barriers to realizing value
To unlock AI’s full potential, insurers should address 
critical foundational activities early on, as failing to do 
so can stall progress through the phases of adoption. 
Key barriers include an incomplete vision for the future 
operating model, outdated foundational and technology 
infrastructure, and inadequate governance frameworks 
to mitigate risks and uphold ethical standards. Equally 
vital is securing the buy-in of leaders and employees by 
demonstrating AI’s transformative potential — not just 
for the organization, but for their personal growth and 
success. These foundational elements are essential to 
sustaining momentum and achieving meaningful value 
creation. Specific areas for focus include:
Managing strategy implementation 
As insurers move toward and through the second phase, 
the barriers to realizing AI’s value are no longer about 
isolated pilots but instead how to scale AI across the 
organization. This requires a profound transformation 
of capabilities, structures and leadership. Insurers, 
traditionally organized around products like auto, health 
or property insurance, should transition to value streams 
that focus on comprehensive customer journeys, such 
as family protection or business risk management. This 
shift disrupts legacy structures and necessitates new 
workflows that span departments, fostering end-to-end 
integration. 
Compounding this challenge is the need for expertise in 
AI orchestration, data integration and customer-centric 
design. Change management becomes critical, as 
insurers should not only implement new technologies but 
also drive cultural acceptance of new operating models. 
Poorly managed transitions risk low adoption, employee 
dissatisfaction and stalled transformation efforts, 
undermining the potential of AI at scale.
Managing the risk 
As AI is scaled across insurers, the risks grow 
exponentially, encompassing not only technological 
challenges but also organizational and reputational 
vulnerabilities. Executives must grapple with the known 
and unknown risks that AI introduces, such as biases 
in underwriting algorithms, inaccuracies in claims 
automation and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. Insurers 
face significant regulatory and compliance challenges, 
particularly in areas like data privacy, ethical decision-
making and the transparency of AI models. Regulators 
increasingly demand explainability and fairness in AI 
systems, especially in sensitive processes like pricing and 
claims adjudication. As the consequences of missteps 
could damage customer trust and invite regulatory 
scrutiny, overcoming these risks requires robust 
governance frameworks and proactive engagement with 
regulators to help ensure compliance and build trust.
Leaders of the future will need to be able 
to understand both the pitch of how great 
AI is, but also how it needs a robust risk 
and control management around it.

Second phase
Upskilling the workforce 
Leadership plays a pivotal role in this transformation. 
Traditional, risk-averse leadership styles in insurance may 
struggle to support the cross-functional collaboration and 
experimentation AI demands. Leaders must champion 
the move to value streams, empower and trust teams 
to innovate and foster a culture of adaptability and 
continuous learning. Without transformational leadership, 
scaling AI can falter, leaving the organization stuck in 
fragmented silos. 
The specialized skills required for AI are in high 
demand but short supply. Without capabilities such as 
model development, prompt engineering and solution 
architecting, AI investments are bound to remain 
fragmented, with their full potential unrealized. Insurers 
will likely need a structured development program to 
equip employees with these skills as roles evolve to 
include oversight, customer advisory and strategic 
decision-making. Upskilling programs, clear career 
pathways and active employee engagement can relieve 
uncertainty and fears about job security.
The technology evolution 
Scaling AI in insurance requires significant investment 
in advanced technologies, including machine learning 
platforms, predictive analytics and scalable cloud-based 
infrastructures. These investments often compete with 
existing IT priorities, creating delays and challenges in 
aligning budgets with AI roadmaps. Legacy systems 
further exacerbate the problem, as they struggle to 
support real-time data integration and the complex 
processing demands of AI. At the same time, as AI 
becomes deeply embedded in processes, transparency 
and accountability become critical. Without robust 
frameworks for explainability and trust, both internal 
stakeholders and external regulators may resist further 
adoption. Insurers should prioritize these investments 
to ensure their technology stack can support 
enterprise-scale AI while maintaining confidence among 
employees, customers and regulators.
Data quality [is a challenge]. High-
quality data is the foundation for AI 
applications, but the processes of data 
collection — cleaning and labeling are 
complex. There may be issues with 
incomplete or inaccurate data. Technical 
integration, while integrating new AI 
technologies with existing systems 
and business processes is a complex 
process; it requires solving compatibility 
and interface issues.

The Chief Information Officer of a large insurance company based in the UK is responsible for the company’s technology stack, including information security and AI initiatives. 
Under their leadership, the company began exploring AI in earnest in 2023, prompted by board-level interest and recognition of AI’s transformative potential.
Current AI usage
Streamlining operations and elevating customer 
experiences 
The organization has embraced AI across a wide range of 
applications, driving innovation and operational efficiency. Key 
areas include fraud detection, where advanced algorithms identify 
suspicious activities with speed and accuracy, and customer 
relationship management (CRM), which uses AI to personalize 
interactions and streamline sales processes. In underwriting, AI 
has reduced the time required to process vast quantities of data, 
enabling faster and more precise pricing decisions. AI has also 
supported call center agents in resolving customer queries faster, 
improving both customer satisfaction and agent productivity. In 
software development, tools like GitHub Copilot have increased 
efficiency, with developers completing tasks faster and with 
fewer errors. The organization has also seen an internal culture 
shift, establishing AI and data academies to educate employees 
about the ethical and effective use of AI. 
Challenges
Overcoming the complexity 
of integrating transformative 
technologies in a regulated and 
traditional industry and enabling a 
cultural shift toward AI
The company faces several key challenges in 
implementing AI, including navigating stringent 
regulatory compliance such as GDPR and 
data sovereignty, managing cultural shifts to 
ensure employees embrace AI responsibly, and 
addressing technical hurdles like cleaning legacy 
data and overcoming siloed systems. Additionally, 
ensuring AI outputs are unbiased, reliable and 
free from errors remains critical, alongside 
making significant investments in infrastructure 
and expertise to support scalable and effective AI 
solutions. 
Organization’s AI outlook
AI-driven innovation and 
responsible growth
They view AI as a game changer for the 
insurance industry, helping to automate 
mundane tasks, but also enhance 
personalization (e.g. offering well priced 
and tailored products to improve customer 
satisfaction and loyalty) as well as empower 
employees (e.g. helping to drive employee 
satisfaction in high-stress areas such as 
call centers). The leadership approach 
emphasizes clear objectives, responsible 
usage and fostering a safe environment for 
experimentation. The CIO believes in enabling 
employees to explore AI’s potential within 
defined boundaries to drive innovation without 
compromising security or compliance.

The third phase: Evolve 
Evolving your 
ecosystem
The Evolve phase transforms enterprises to adapt to market 
disruptions, forming new business models and ecosystems 
to solve larger, industry-wide problems. Companies establish 
ecosystems with customers, suppliers and governments, 
orchestrated by AI to deliver seamless value. As costs come 
down, existing markets will grow and new ones will emerge.
AI integrates with frontier technologies like quantum computing, blockchain 
and advanced visualization, driving breakthroughs in innovation in products 
and services and involving close collaboration with customers, key alliances 
and partners. Ethics, safety and trust are paramount, with real-time monitoring 
and security updates helping ensure platform integrity. This phase emphasizes 
uplifting human potential, improving experiences, and providing robust training 
and support to help the workforce transition into a creative, imaginative future 
of value creation and collaboration.
In the third phase, organizations use predictive insights to continuously 
optimize for better, more sustainable outcomes. AI agents, no longer inhibited 
by silos and organized along value streams, can enable embedded intelligence 
in core processes, improving customer experiences and product value.
The third phase gives the biggest payoff. As AI enables 
costs to come down, some markets will grow, some 
decline and new ones emerge. Invest in areas of price 
elasticity — things we can do more of with AI as costs 
decline. Your competitors may focus more on what is 
disappearing and risk being replaced.

Third phase
AI-driven ecosystem platforms: Insurers can create platforms that 
connect various stakeholders within the insurance value chain. For 
example, insurers could offer digitally connected home insurance 
products that link policyholders with home security providers, 
emergency responders and repair services — in real time.
Predictive maintenance and risk prevention: AI can move insurers 
from a reactive to a preventive model. IoT data and AI reduce claims 
by transforming risk management into a predictive and autonomous 
process, enabling greater safety and risk prevention.
New product categories: AI opens new possibilities for product 
innovation. Insurers could offer microinsurance products or pay-per-
use policies tailored to specific, short-term needs, such as coverage 
for individual travel days or temporary workers.
AI use cases in the third phase
As such it represents a transformative shift in the insurance industry, redefining its 
core purpose and operating models. Traditionally, insurance has been built around 
resolution — responding to claims and mitigating losses after risks materialize. 
However, AI’s full potential in this wave will fundamentally alter this paradigm, enabling 
insurers to transition from reactive resolution to proactive prevention. 
With advanced AI capabilities such as predictive analytics, real-time monitoring and 
autonomous decision-making, insurers will anticipate risks before they occur, working 
alongside customers to prevent losses entirely. For example, instead of merely 
processing claims for water damage, insurers will leverage internet-enabled devices 
(IoT) and AI to detect and mitigate leaks before they escalate into significant issues, 
creating a more valuable and proactive relationship with policyholders.
Self-driving cars, for example, will likely change the nature of auto insurance as the risk 
no longer resides with the human driver. Insurers may offer new products to cover the 
risks of self-driving cars, such as cyber liability and technology errors. Insurance may 
not only use AI, but insure the risks of using AI.
It is only by successfully navigating these phases that insurers can evolve into 
ecosystem enablers, embedding themselves into customers’ daily lives and 
collaborating with partners across industries to create holistic solutions.

Key considerations
The research reveals that there are four key actions executives need to take if they are to create 
value in an AI-driven enterprise.
Leaders must craft a vision that aligns core competencies — product innovation, customer 
success, data management and ecosystem partnerships — with AI capabilities, while 
ensuring accountability for execution and outcomes. Leadership accountability is critical to 
ensure that the vision translates into measurable impact. Leaders should actively engage with 
ecosystem players, fostering collaboration to strengthen AI strategies. By uniting teams across 
engineering, product and data science, and focusing on market leadership and customer experience 
innovation, leaders can drive alignment and ensure measurable impact from AI initiatives.
Design an AI strategy that aligns with core competencies 
and unlocks value
1
•	
Define a unified AI vision and strategy
Insurers must articulate a clear, organization-wide 
vision for AI, tied to specific, actionable outcomes. 
This ensures all teams understand how AI initiatives 
contribute to customer-centric goals, such as tailored 
policy offerings or faster claims resolution.
•	
Establish cross-functional collaboration
Breaking down silos between underwriting, claims 
and product teams is essential for aligning AI with 
innovation goals. Cross-functional teams focused on 
value streams enable insurers to develop AI solutions 
that enhance operational efficiency and customer 
satisfaction.
•	
Implement measurable objectives and key 
results (OKRs)
Insurers should adopt performance measurement 
frameworks that include objectives and key results 
to track AI’s success. Key performance metrics 
should link to strategic business outcomes such as 
customer retention, underwriting efficiency or claims 
satisfaction, ensuring progress remains aligned with 
organizational goals.
Key actions
In addition to implementing AI to support various business 
processes […] we also rolled out AI and data training academies 
for our employees to educate and create a cultural shift 
towards using the technology in a mindful, responsible and 
knowledgeable way.

There’s the whole thing around governance 
and regulations that is yet to come. And for 
any serious business that wants to invest 
in this technology and start developing this 
technology, they need to put aside some 
of that money and start getting involved 
working with the government and AI groups, 
to help form some of these regulations and to 
understand the ethics around it.
Chief Technology Officer — UK
As insurers advance through the three phases of AI 
adoption, the risks and potential for reputational damage 
grow exponentially. Governance, ethics and compliance 
are critical to maintaining stakeholder trust and ensuring 
AI unlocks its transformative potential.
Build trust into 
your roadmap 
2
•	
Establish robust AI governance 
frameworks
Insurers should implement comprehensive 
AI governance structures that set clear 
standards for accountability, transparency 
and compliance. These frameworks should 
define roles and responsibilities, establish 
protocols for monitoring AI performance and 
proactively address risks such as algorithmic 
accountability and ethical considerations.
•	
Embed ethical and bias-detection 
mechanisms
Ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in 
AI systems is essential. Insurers should 
develop tools to continuously audit AI 
models for unintended biases, especially 
in sensitive areas like underwriting and 
claims adjudication. This requires diverse, 
representative datasets and regular model 
testing, with independent oversight from 
ethics boards to enhance credibility and 
compliance.
•	
Prioritize privacy by design
Given the vast amount of customer data 
insurers manage, integrating privacy 
considerations into every stage of AI 
development is crucial. Adopting a “privacy by 
design” approach can ensure compliance with 
regulations like GDPR while building customer 
trust. This includes implementing encryption, 
anonymization and secure data-sharing 
practices as standard.
•	
Invest in security and resilience
AI systems in insurance are attractive targets 
for cyberattacks, such as model poisoning 
or adversarial attacks. Insurers should invest 
in advanced security measures, including 
real-time anomaly detection, regular defense 
updates and staff training to address emerging 
threats. Resilience ensures AI systems can 
operate reliably even during disruptions.

effective AI. Insurers should invest in 
advanced data platforms that consolidate 
siloed datasets into a single source of truth. 
Tools for data quality, lineage and security 
ensure AI models are reliable and adaptable to 
evolving business needs.
•	
Focus on modular and interoperable 
solutions
Future-proofing technology stacks with 
modular AI systems ensures integration with 
existing tools and emerging innovations. Open 
APIs and vendor-agnostic solutions allow 
insurers to experiment without locking into

communication, active employee engagement 
and support systems. Insurers should address 
fears of job displacement by demonstrating 
how AI augments roles, builds skills and 
improves efficiency, fostering buy-in through 
co-created solutions.
•	
Redefine roles and career pathways
AI will likely reshape roles within insurance, 
shifting employees toward higher-value 
activities like customer engagement and 
strategic decision-making. Insurers should 
clearly map these new career opportunities 
and establish roles like AI ethics officers or 
value-stream leaders to align human expertise 
with AI capabilities.

KPMG conducted an extensive research program, interviewing executive leaders across eight key global markets to understand the impact of AI on the insurance industry. The emergence of generative AI, along with the next wave of autonomous and agentic AI systems, is unlocking entirely new possibilities for innovation across the sector. Our research provides a detailed blueprint for insurance organizations to harness AI’s potential value.
believe that Insurance firms that embrace AI will develop a competitive edge over those who do not
expect a moderate to very high ROI
face significant pressure from shareholders to show immediate ROI on AI investment
will increase the percentage of global budget spent on AI
of which
and
of leaders have reservations about whether AI can be trusted while only
fully trust AI within their organizations
recognize the importance of establishing robust frameworks, policies and processes for regulatory compliance to ensure responsible AI implementation
To address these challenges, KPMG introduces the three phases of AI value — a framework designed to guide insurers through the AI adoption journey. This phased approach provides a structured roadmap, helping insurers prioritize investments, align initiatives with business goals, and position themselves effectively in the age of AI in insurance.
The Enable phase focuses on enabling people and building AI foundations. Organisations appoint a responsible executive, create an AI strategy, identify high-value use cases, boost AI literacy, align with regulations and establish ethical guardrails. AI pilots are launched across functions, while cloud platforms and pre-trained models are leveraged with minimal customisation.
The Embed phase integrates AI into workflows, products, services, value streams, robotics, and wearables, delivering greater value. A senior leader drives enterprise-wide workforce redesign, re-skilling and change, embedding AI into operating models with a focus on ethics, trust and security. AI agents and diverse models are deployed, supported by cloud and legacy tech modernisation, while enterprise-wide data enhances operations.
The Evolve phase evolves business models and ecosystems, using AI and frontier technologies like quantum computing and blockchain to solve large sector-wide challenges. AI orchestrates seamless value across enterprises and partners. Emphasizing ethics and trust with real-time security, this phase uplifts human potential with broad and deep workforce training, fostering a creative, innovative and value-driven future.
This research outlines a comprehensive blueprint for AI in insurance, helping insurers chart a path towards unlocking AI’s immense value.

Intelligent insurance: A blueprint for creating value through AI-driven transformation | 2
AI has been a part of the insurance industry for 
some time, but its adoption varies significantly 
based on insurance type, geography and the 
distinction between legacy insurers and insurtech 
disruptors. The emergence of generative AI, along 
with the next wave of autonomous and agentic AI 
systems, is unlocking entirely new possibilities for 
innovation across the sector. 
However, while some insurers are doubling down on AI 
investment to drive competitive advantage, others remain 
cautious, either due to regulatory concerns, legacy 
constraints, or uncertainty about AI’s long-term impact 
on their business models. This growing divide between 
AI leaders and more conservative adopters will shape the 
future trajectory of AI-driven transformation in insurance. 
AI adoption in life and non-life insurance for example 
differs considerably. Non-life insurers, dealing with high-
frequency claims in areas like auto and home insurance, 
have been using AI primarily for “back office” functions 
such as fraud detection, real-time risk assessment, 
automated claims processing and dynamic pricing. 
Their focus is on speed and operational efficiency, using 
structured external data such as telematics, Internet of 
things (IoT) and geospatial risk analysis. 
Foreword
AI is more than a technology investment for insurers — it is a transformative 
catalyst for redefining strategy, culture and operations. To fully unlock its 
potential, insurers must overcome inertia, embrace its possibilities and embed AI 
as a core driver of customer-centric and sustainable growth. 
Frank Pfaffenzeller 
Global Head of Insurance 
KPMG International
In contrast, life insurers managing long-term risks rely 
on biometric, medical and behavioral data to assess 
longevity and morbidity. AI is revolutionizing their 
underwriting processes by automating risk segmentation, 
integrating electronic health records and utilizing predictive 
analytics to refine policy pricing and assessment. Life 
insurers are integrating wearable data and wellness tracking 
to personalize policy pricing, rewarding healthy behaviors. 
AI is also improving claims automation by identifying 
fraud, analyzing death certificates and streamlining 
payouts through machine learning. Beyond underwriting 
and claims, AI is transforming longevity modeling and 
regulatory compliance in life insurance. Predictive 
analytics powered by AI can assess life expectancy, 
detect disease onset and optimize risk stratification, 
enabling insurers to refine pricing and payout structures. 
However, these solutions are often developed to solve a 
specific problem, but there is an opportunity to quickly 
adjust for wider use across the value chain. Gen AI and 
autonomous agents could empower organizations to 
enhance actuarial models, deliver personalized insurance 
cover or even increase the pace of insurance claims. 
But this will likely require an enterprise-wide view, 
breaking down organizational silos and using AI to 
monitor and mitigate its own risks. 
The insurers that embrace these challenges can be first 
to unlock AI’s transformative potential.

Introduction
At a glance
The rise of agentic, autonomous AI agents 
represents a fundamental shift in how insurance 
companies will operate, interact with customers 
and manage risk. Unlike traditional AI, which 
primarily enhances efficiency through automation 
and analytics, these next-generation agents can 
independently make decisions, execute complex 
tasks and continuously learn from interactions.
In insurance, this means policies that dynamically adjust 
based on real-time risk factors, claims that are processed 
and settled instantly without human intervention, and 
customer service that is hyper-personalized, context-
aware and available 24/7. 
The potential extends beyond operational 
improvements — agentic AI can redefine entire business 
models, enabling insurers to proactively mitigate risk, 
optimize pricing dynamically and provide unprecedented 
levels of customer engagement. 
These systems demand vast, high-quality data inputs, 
meaning insurers must invest in seamless data 
integration, real-time analytics and ethical AI governance. 
However, our research finds that insurers are still 
grappling with legacy operating models, technical debt 
and linear workflows, which are ill-equipped to handle 
the dynamic nature of AI innovation. Data is fragmented 
and often locked in functional specific systems. Rigid 
hierarchies and siloed functions create choke points 
that impede cross-functional collaboration, slow 
decision-making and limit agility.
Concerns about the rapid pace of technology 
development and caution over the AI-specific risks are 
causing hesitancy: 75 percent of insurance executives 
in our survey are concerned that investments they make 
now may be rendered obsolete in the near future. 
Insurers are also hesitating when it comes to build or 
buy decisions and worried that a vendor may release a 
better version. 
When coupled with concerns over the unknown risks, 
AI leaders are unsure where and when to focus their 
investments.

Key considerations
Introduction
At a glance
Introduction
Insurance executives worry about premature AI investments amid rapid technological change. Here are four key considerations to guide no-regrets actions, 
helping insurers build flexibility and responsiveness to adapt to an AI future: 
Design an AI strategy that aligns 
with core competencies and 
unlocks value
Insurers should establish a bold vision for 
AI that aligns with their core strengths. 
This vision should guide a disruptive 
transformation road map that redefines how 
AI drives growth and innovation while holding 
teams accountable for results. Aligning AI 
deployments with strategic goals — such 
as improving fraud detection, streamlining 
underwriting and enhancing customer 
personalization — can help maximize ROI.
Build trust into the 
transformation road map
AI in insurance introduces unique risks 
that can undermine trust, meaning 
proactive risk management is critical 
from the outset. Insurers should address 
data privacy and security challenges, 
helping ensure compliance with financial 
regulations while protecting sensitive 
customer information.
Combatting algorithmic bias and 
adopting explainable AI systems that 
regulators, customers and internal 
stakeholders can trust are critical.
Create sustainable technology 
and data infrastructure for AI 
adoption
Data is a critical strategic asset and 
the foundation for all AI initiatives. 
Insurers should build a robust data 
governance framework, focusing on 
quality, integration and security, while 
also creating a foundation for long-term 
scalability. This includes investing 
in enterprise-grade AI infrastructure 
that can support high volumes of 
transactions, complex risk models and 
real-time decision-making. 
Build a culture that uses AI to 
uplift human potential
A multifaceted talent strategy that 
balances retention with upskilling should 
be a key priority. Academic institutions, 
fintech startups and innovation hubs can 
inject fresh perspectives and enhance 
workforce capabilities. Immersive AI 
training programs help to drive innovation 
in customer experiences and operational 
models, diversify hiring pipelines and 
enable transformative outcomes.​

findings
Current state
Insurance is an industry in transition. Historic investments in digital 
transformation are now being updated to incorporate AI, but data fragmentation 
caused by legacy operating models is inhibiting progress.
Organizational models are in transition
Insurance companies are changing to more customer-centric models, but progress 
remains uneven. Thirty-eight percent are still organized by independent functions with 
clear boundaries, while 44 percent are experimenting with hybrid models such as 
functional-agile combinations. 
Technology infrastructure in transition is evolving
Most insurers are still on the journey to modernizing their technology. While 60 percent 
have partially modernized their systems with cloud capabilities, only 18 percent have 
achieved a fully cloud-based infrastructure. 
Operating models inhibit consistent AI implementation
Operating models often hinder the consistent alignment of AI initiatives with business 
goals. Only 23 percent of insurers report operating models that effectively align AI 
with strategic objectives, while just 24 percent can achieve cross-functional alignment 
on AI projects. Furthermore, only 30 percent consistently integrate workflows across 
departments, creating silos that slow progress.
On-premises technology still dominates
Despite the push toward modernization, 59 percent of insurers rely on on-premises 
AI solutions and 55 percent are developing customized AI tools in-house. While these 
approaches offer control, they may lack the flexibility needed for scaling AI to meet 
future demands.
We have legacy infrastructure and applications. We 
have silos and we need to do more work with our 
data to ensure it is clean and accurate.

Research findings
Links are being made to synergistic 
technologies
Encouragingly, insurers are leveraging synergistic 
technologies to enhance AI’s impact. Fifty-seven 
percent have integrated AI with Robotic Process 
Automation (RPA), and 58 percent have data analytics 
platforms with AI capabilities.
AI is impacting key functions
Even with limited implementation, AI is beginning to 
deliver significant benefits across critical functions. 
Fifty-nine percent of insurers report a transformative 
impact on operations, while 58 percent see 
improvements in information technology (IT), 
supply chain and logistics.
Staff education on AI
Staff education remains foundational, with 61 percent of 
employees receiving AI training focused mainly on basic 
awareness. However, only 23 percent have undergone 
in-depth, comprehensive training, highlighting a need for 
more robust learning programs to equip employees for 
advanced AI applications.
Barriers to progress
For many insurance leaders, the primary concern is 
whether regulatory frameworks and risk management 
practices can evolve quickly enough to keep pace with 
advancing technology.
Building trust is a major concern—and priority
Trust in AI remains a significant hurdle for insurers. 
Forty-six percent of leaders have reservations about 
whether AI can be trusted while only 25 percent fully 
trust AI within their organizations. Eighty-two percent 
recognize the importance of establishing robust 
frameworks, policies and processes for regulatory 
compliance to ensure responsible AI implementation.
The AI vision is still being formed
While AI is a growing priority, alignment to a clear, 
strategic vision remains incomplete. Sixty-two percent of 
insurers are only partially aligned to an AI vision, and just 
19 percent have a fully integrated plan linking AI to goals 
at all levels. 
I think it’s the ethics of it, the accountability 
piece, understanding AI — the visibility and 
transparency of what your AI is doing…
When it goes wrong, a human needs to be 
accountable. Therefore, I think leaders need 
to understand ethics a lot more.

Research findings
Data readiness remains a challenge
Data management continues to be a critical barrier 
to scaling AI in insurance. Seventy-two percent of 
insurers identify data as their primary challenge, with 
only 34 percent achieving system-level data integration. 
Furthermore, just 13 percent have a data warehouse 
with real-time updates, and only 7 percent have fully 
automated data integration, highlighting significant gaps 
in data readiness for AI initiatives.
There is a conflict with sustainability 
commitments
The energy demands of AI are creating tension with 
insurers’ sustainability goals. Seventy-two percent 
struggle to balance AI’s increased energy usage with 
sustainability commitments, and 75 percent view meeting 
sustainability objectives as a higher strategic imperative 
than implementing AI. However, 79 percent have plans to 
mitigate AI’s energy demands, signaling awareness and a 
proactive approach to addressing it.
The rapid evolution of technology fuels inertia
The rapid pace of AI development is creating uncertainty 
among insurers, with 75 percent preferring to wait for 
the AI landscape to stabilize before making significant 
investments. Additionally, 58 percent feel overwhelmed 
by the volume of AI-related information and hype, and 
56 percent express concerns about the level of control AI 
technology providers might exert over their business.
You have outdated legacy systems and 
what is important, you also have data drift. 
What is data drift? You have silos, and every 
silo has its own database. And databases 
aren’t connected to each other. Every time 
the data is updated, we have data drift. 
Head of Strategy — Germany
Moving forward
These statistics highlight the complex challenges insurers 
face as they navigate AI adoption. Despite efforts to 
implement AI, the fragmented strategies and limited 
readiness illustrates the need for a more structured 
approach. 
Our research reveals that many respondents believe 
they are further along in their AI journey than their actual 
maturity levels indicate. This disconnect arises from 
being in the early stages of implementation, where 
initial gains mask the broader transformative potential 
of AI across the industry. To help insurers accurately 
assess their position in the AI development cycle and 
effectively prioritize initiatives, we introduce the three 
phases of the AI Value framework: Enable people, Embed 
AI in work and Evolve the enterprise to help insurers 
move from foundational capabilities to enterprise-wide 
transformation and ecosystem innovation. By 
addressing these barriers progressively, insurers can 
unlock AI’s transformative potential while mitigating 
risks. This framework helps ensure that AI becomes a 
sustainable and strategic enabler for long-term growth, 
competitiveness and resilience.

Enterprise
This layer orchestrates transformational change of the whole 
enterprise, starting with how AI can adjust strategy, business models 
and key objectives for the enterprise. It defines enterprise-wide 
operating model shifts, workforce evolution and risks and controls. 
This layer prioritizes AI transformation initiatives into a roadmap and 
runs a transformation office to help manage funding, track benefits 
and adjust priorities dynamically to help maximize the value delivered.
Functions
This layer drives AI-enabled transformation across business functions, 
prioritizing customer-facing value streams and end-to-end enabling 
processes and workflows, which enhance the flow of value such 
as underwriting, claims processing, fraud detection and customer 
engagement. AI applications, agents and robotics are embedded in 
the workflows. Functional operating model changes are delivered to 
realize potential benefits.
Foundations
This layer establishes the AI-first technology stack, including 
infrastructure, cloud and choices on chips. High-quality enterprise data 
needs to be curated, and diverse models are likely to be deployed to 
handle domain-specific AI. An increased focus on cybersecurity for AI is 
needed as well as a plan for other emerging technology, such as quantum.
Successfully implementing AI in an organization involves a strategic approach to 
building capability across foundational, functional and enterprise layers. Establishing 
a transformation management office is also crucial for aligning AI strategy, value 
orchestration and project delivery across all layers. The body coordinates initiatives, 
establishes standards and best practices, and facilitates cross-functional collaboration 
to drive accountability and enterprise-wide value.
Insurers have steadily transformed their operations with technologies like digital 
platforms, cloud computing and agile methodologies, integrating AI with new 
technologies like robotics and IoT. Now, new AI technologies and increased 
regulatory scrutiny are further transforming the industry. These trends demand 
that insurers navigate an environment where investing in technological 
innovation while maintaining compliance is critical.

Introduction
At a glance
Building the intelligent insurer
Our survey found that the path to value in AI is uneven 
across the organization, with innovation in some areas 
being easier or more worthwhile to pursue than in others. 
For example, some areas of the same organization will 
focus on foundational efficiencies (the first phase), other 
functions or value streams may be scaling AI for growth 
(the second phase), and a few may even be exploring 
transformative opportunities within ecosystems (the third 
phase). In fact, while no insurer we surveyed has fully 
achieved the third phase maturity, 13 percent of sector 
leaders report undertaking activities that demonstrate 
third phase characteristics.
As insurers progress through the three phases, their 
operating models will undergo a profound transformation, 
reshaping how they design products, engage with 
customers and position themselves in the broader 
ecosystem. They will shift from offering standardized 
products developed through lengthy and rigid approval 
processes to creating highly personalized, dynamic 
coverage tailored to individual customer needs in 
real time. AI will help insurers analyze vast amounts 
of customer data, such as lifestyle preferences, 
behaviors and risk profiles, allowing them to design and 
adjust products on demand, improving relevance and 
responsiveness. This flexibility will replace the traditional 
one-size-fits-all approach, delivering superior customer 
value and fostering loyalty. 
Simultaneously, insurers will evolve from being primarily 
product providers working through distribution partners, 
such as brokers and agents, to becoming integral 
players in larger, connected ecosystems. In this new 
role, they can collaborate seamlessly with ecosystem 
partners across industries — healthcare, mobility, 
retail and beyond — co-creating solutions that address 
comprehensive customer needs.

Enable
The Enable phase focuses on enabling people and 
building AI foundations. Organizations appoint a 
responsible executive, create an AI strategy, identify 
high-value use cases, boost AI literacy, align with 
regulations and establish ethical guardrails. AI pilots 
are launched across functions, while cloud platforms 
and pre-trained models are leveraged with minimal 
customization.
Embed
The Embed phase delivers greater value by integrating 
AI into workflows. A senior leader drives enterprise-
wide workforce redesign, re-skilling and change, 
embedding AI into operating models with a focus 
on ethics, trust and security. AI agents and diverse 
models are deployed, supported by cloud and legacy 
tech modernization, while enterprise-wide data 
enhances operations.
Evolve
The Evolve phase evolves business models and 
ecosystems, using AI and frontier technologies like 
quantum computing and blockchain to solve large 
sector-wide challenges. AI can orchestrate seamless 
value across enterprises and partners. Emphasizing 
ethics and trust with real-time security, this phase 
uplifts human potential with broad and deep 
workforce training, fostering a creative, innovative 
and value-driven future.
A company may have a portfolio of initiatives aimed at any level (of the operating model) within each phase. The ratio of effort and investment across the phases will vary as the 
organization matures. Initially, most resources will focus on phase one, with a small effort to explore enterprise-wide transformation. Over time, as foundational efficiencies are 
realized, more effort is invested in phase two, while, with an eye on the future, long-term investments in phase three start to lay the groundwork for transformative innovation.  
This dynamic balancing act ensures insurers can achieve immediate results while setting themselves up in the right way for future success.
The journey to become an intelligent insurer
Effective AI-enabled transformation goes beyond technology implementation. By examining leading practice, we have 
identified that insurers can increase capability and value across three phases of AI transformation. 
This provides a structured yet flexible framework for navigating the complexities of AI adoption. It balances the need for 
short-term efficiency gains with the imperative to prepare for future growth and innovation. It helps insurers prioritize 
their efforts, allocate resources effectively, build capability and align their AI initiatives with short-term goals and 
long-term strategic objectives.

Phases of the 
AI journey
Focusing on maturity across the three phases — 
Enable, Embed and Evolve — is critical for 
sustained value creation. It requires increasing 
the maturity of the capabilities that are vital to 
the foundations, functions and enterprise layers 
simultaneously. 
At the enterprise layer, increased AI maturity involves 
orchestrating AI across functions to enable enterprise-
wide innovation and strategic alignment. Without a 
balanced focus on all three layers, organizations risk 
missing opportunities for transformation.
At the functions layer, AI should be embedded into 
key value streams, optimizing specific processes and 
creating improved outcomes, such as more compelling 
products and services, and more engaging, end-to-end 
employee and customer experiences.
At the foundations layer organizations should build up 
the new AI-first technology stack, through a process 
of technology modernization. Infrastructure, data, 
models and applications can all become optimized for 
delivery of AI.

Enable people 
with AI
There are frequent changes. So, we end up approaching 
this through an investment lens. This is going to get the 
ROI, so that’s where we’ve got to go. Instead of a future-
based thing, where we’re saying this is what our company 
will look like and so let’s get pulled into that future, it’s 
more like, let’s place our bets. 
Director of AI Strategy — US

The Enable phase is about enabling people and establishing the foundations 
for AI adoption. At the enterprise level, this includes appointing a responsible 
executive, developing an AI strategy, identifying high-value use cases, 
increasing AI literacy, aligning with regulations and introducing ethical 
guardrails. At the function level, businesses pilot AI solutions across various 
areas, building skills, fostering innovation and learning from these initial 
implementations. At the foundation level, organizations leverage cloud 
platforms and pre-trained AI models from strategic providers with limited 
customization. This phase focuses on creating awareness, experimentation 
and alignment to ensure the organization is prepared for broader AI integration. 
Budget reduction is a major focus. The emphasis is on improving the 
productivity of the knowledge worker by outsourcing back-office functions 
to tools like robotic process automation. That will improve accuracy while 
reducing manual effort, enabling employees to focus on negotiating with 
suppliers and cutting costs.
With AI the key objective, the first phase is to identify low-hanging fruit 
where AI can deliver quick, measurable wins by automating routine tasks, 
streamlining workflows and reducing manual labor. In addition to chatbots, 
insurers are using AI to digitize and process paperwork, including policy 
applications. Insurers are also automating simple processes; in fact, AI’s ability 
to streamline claims processing while improving accuracy is one of the most 
immediate and tangible benefits for the industry.1 This can reduce settlement 
time from days or weeks to hours.

Claims processing automation: Claims processing has long 
been a pain point for both insurers and customers. AI-driven 
systems can improve processing time, reduce operational costs 
and increase customer satisfaction. At an industry leader based 
in the US, for example, machine learning algorithms can analyze 
photos of vehicle damage or natural disasters and immediately 
assess repair costs. 
Underwriting efficiency and precision: Traditionally, 
underwriting has been a highly manual process that 
relies heavily on historical data and actuarial science. AI is 
transforming this process by introducing predictive modeling 
and machine learning algorithms that can assess risk with 
far greater precision and speed. These technologies allow 
underwriters to analyze a broader range of data points in 
real time, including social media activity, environmental data and 
even satellite imagery.
Fraud detection: According to Insurance Europe, fraud costs 
insurers some US$14 billion a year — it is a pressing and 
insidious problem. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of 
data to identify potential fraudulent claims faster and more 
accurately than manual processes, reducing fraud-related 
losses and boosting overall profitability.

The second phase: Embed 
Embedding AI in 
the flow of work
The Embed phase integrates AI into end-to-end workflows, products, 
services and value streams, transforming how work is performed 
across the enterprise and delivering greater value. AI enables large 
teams to handle complex tasks and enhances efficiency. A senior 
leader oversees enterprise-wide change, setting strategic goals and 
embedding AI into operating models, robotics and wearable devices. 
This phase emphasizes ethics, inclusion, safety, security and trust. 
AI agents, along with diverse models (large, small, open, closed and 
domain-specific), are embedded into workflows, supported by data 
from various sources. Infrastructure combines cloud resources with 
on-premises GPUs, with a strong focus on security.
While many processes may still be in the first phase, insurers can 
begin to explore how AI can be used for value creation. In this phase, 
AI is not just a tool for cost savings; it becomes central to driving 
business growth, improving the customer experience, generating 
new revenue streams and improving the productivity of entire teams. 
As AI becomes more deeply integrated into core functions, insurance 
operating models are being redesigned to streamline end-to-end 
workflows and enhance customer outcomes. This transformation 
shifts the focus from traditional, product-centric structures (e.g. auto, 
home or life insurance) to value streams that cut across products and 
functions and address the holistic needs of the customer.
Customers are being provided with more personalized, 
more precisely priced products, which satisfy their needs 
better than in the past. Personalization is a major part 
of customer benefits, leading to customer satisfaction, 
customer loyalty and willingness to buy our products rather 
than competitors.

These value streams cut across functions, such as marketing, underwriting and customer 
service, to focus on holistic customer outcomes. With advanced analytics and machine 
learning, insurers can analyze vast amounts of customer data to understand individual 
preferences, behaviors and risk profiles. This enables the creation of tailored policies that 
meet specific customer needs, replacing traditional one-size-fits-all offerings. 
Shared data platforms and AI-driven insights that strengthen collaboration between business 
units make this possible, while AI-powered tools empower employees to take on higher-value 
advisory roles. Key metrics of success shift from cost reduction alone to include measures of 
customer satisfaction, cross-sell effectiveness and speed-to-market for new services.
AI-enhanced customer journeys: AI can be used to analyze 
customer behavior and predict needs, allowing insurers to offer 
personalized products and services at the right moment. For example, 
using machine learning models, insurers can anticipate life events like 
marriage or home purchases and proactively offer relevant insurance 
products to customers.
Dynamic risk modeling: In this phase, AI enables real-time risk 
assessment by incorporating dynamic data sources, such as Internet-
of-things (IoT) data or behavioral insights, to provide more precise risk 
modeling and pricing. 
Data privacy: Advanced AI algorithms can detect and classify 
personal data in real time, ensuring that it is securely stored and 
accessed only by authorized personnel. AI-driven tools can also 
monitor for unusual activity, flagging potential breaches or compliance 
risks early. 
Autonomous customer engagement: Agentic AI in a redesigned 
value chain enables the creation of tailored property and 
casualty (P&C) insurance products during customer interactions, 
replacing standard, limited options with highly personalized coverage. 
An AI-powered agent or avatar, trained in regulations and company 
policies, configures bespoke insurance solutions based on the 
customer’s needs and risk profile, seamlessly integrating risk 
acceptance, compliance and pricing models in real time.

Second phase
Barriers to realizing value
To unlock AI’s full potential, insurers should address 
critical foundational activities early on, as failing to do 
so can stall progress through the phases of adoption. 
Key barriers include an incomplete vision for the future 
operating model, outdated foundational and technology 
infrastructure, and inadequate governance frameworks 
to mitigate risks and uphold ethical standards. Equally 
vital is securing the buy-in of leaders and employees by 
demonstrating AI’s transformative potential — not just 
for the organization, but for their personal growth and 
success. These foundational elements are essential to 
sustaining momentum and achieving meaningful value 
creation. Specific areas for focus include:
Managing strategy implementation 
As insurers move toward and through the second phase, 
the barriers to realizing AI’s value are no longer about 
isolated pilots but instead how to scale AI across the 
organization. This requires a profound transformation 
of capabilities, structures and leadership. Insurers, 
traditionally organized around products like auto, health 
or property insurance, should transition to value streams 
that focus on comprehensive customer journeys, such 
as family protection or business risk management. This 
shift disrupts legacy structures and necessitates new 
workflows that span departments, fostering end-to-end 
integration. 
Compounding this challenge is the need for expertise in 
AI orchestration, data integration and customer-centric 
design. Change management becomes critical, as 
insurers should not only implement new technologies but 
also drive cultural acceptance of new operating models. 
Poorly managed transitions risk low adoption, employee 
dissatisfaction and stalled transformation efforts, 
undermining the potential of AI at scale.
Managing the risk 
As AI is scaled across insurers, the risks grow 
exponentially, encompassing not only technological 
challenges but also organizational and reputational 
vulnerabilities. Executives must grapple with the known 
and unknown risks that AI introduces, such as biases 
in underwriting algorithms, inaccuracies in claims 
automation and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. Insurers 
face significant regulatory and compliance challenges, 
particularly in areas like data privacy, ethical decision-
making and the transparency of AI models. Regulators 
increasingly demand explainability and fairness in AI 
systems, especially in sensitive processes like pricing and 
claims adjudication. As the consequences of missteps 
could damage customer trust and invite regulatory 
scrutiny, overcoming these risks requires robust 
governance frameworks and proactive engagement with 
regulators to help ensure compliance and build trust.
Leaders of the future will need to be able 
to understand both the pitch of how great 
AI is, but also how it needs a robust risk 
and control management around it.

Upskilling the workforce 
Leadership plays a pivotal role in this transformation. 
Traditional, risk-averse leadership styles in insurance may 
struggle to support the cross-functional collaboration and 
experimentation AI demands. Leaders must champion 
the move to value streams, empower and trust teams 
to innovate and foster a culture of adaptability and 
continuous learning. Without transformational leadership, 
scaling AI can falter, leaving the organization stuck in 
fragmented silos. 
The specialized skills required for AI are in high 
demand but short supply. Without capabilities such as 
model development, prompt engineering and solution 
architecting, AI investments are bound to remain 
fragmented, with their full potential unrealized. Insurers 
will likely need a structured development program to 
equip employees with these skills as roles evolve to 
include oversight, customer advisory and strategic 
decision-making. Upskilling programs, clear career 
pathways and active employee engagement can relieve 
uncertainty and fears about job security.
The technology evolution 
Scaling AI in insurance requires significant investment 
in advanced technologies, including machine learning 
platforms, predictive analytics and scalable cloud-based 
infrastructures. These investments often compete with 
existing IT priorities, creating delays and challenges in 
aligning budgets with AI roadmaps. Legacy systems 
further exacerbate the problem, as they struggle to 
support real-time data integration and the complex 
processing demands of AI. At the same time, as AI 
becomes deeply embedded in processes, transparency 
and accountability become critical. Without robust 
frameworks for explainability and trust, both internal 
stakeholders and external regulators may resist further 
adoption. Insurers should prioritize these investments 
to ensure their technology stack can support 
enterprise-scale AI while maintaining confidence among 
employees, customers and regulators.
Data quality [is a challenge]. High-
quality data is the foundation for AI 
applications, but the processes of data 
collection — cleaning and labeling are 
complex. There may be issues with 
incomplete or inaccurate data. Technical 
integration, while integrating new AI 
technologies with existing systems 
and business processes is a complex 
process; it requires solving compatibility 
and interface issues.

Third phase
AI-driven ecosystem platforms: Insurers can create platforms that 
connect various stakeholders within the insurance value chain. For 
example, insurers could offer digitally connected home insurance 
products that link policyholders with home security providers, 
emergency responders and repair services — in real time.
Predictive maintenance and risk prevention: AI can move insurers 
from a reactive to a preventive model. IoT data and AI reduce claims 
by transforming risk management into a predictive and autonomous 
process, enabling greater safety and risk prevention.
New product categories: AI opens new possibilities for product 
innovation. Insurers could offer microinsurance products or pay-per-
use policies tailored to specific, short-term needs, such as coverage 
for individual travel days or temporary workers.
AI use cases in the third phase
As such it represents a transformative shift in the insurance industry, redefining its 
core purpose and operating models. Traditionally, insurance has been built around 
resolution — responding to claims and mitigating losses after risks materialize. 
However, AI’s full potential in this wave will fundamentally alter this paradigm, enabling 
insurers to transition from reactive resolution to proactive prevention. 
With advanced AI capabilities such as predictive analytics, real-time monitoring and 
autonomous decision-making, insurers will anticipate risks before they occur, working 
alongside customers to prevent losses entirely. For example, instead of merely 
processing claims for water damage, insurers will leverage internet-enabled devices 
(IoT) and AI to detect and mitigate leaks before they escalate into significant issues, 
creating a more valuable and proactive relationship with policyholders.
Self-driving cars, for example, will likely change the nature of auto insurance as the risk 
no longer resides with the human driver. Insurers may offer new products to cover the 
risks of self-driving cars, such as cyber liability and technology errors. Insurance may 
not only use AI, but insure the risks of using AI.
It is only by successfully navigating these phases that insurers can evolve into 
ecosystem enablers, embedding themselves into customers’ daily lives and 
collaborating with partners across industries to create holistic solutions.

Third phase
Key considerations
The research reveals that there are four key actions executives need to take if they are to create 
value in an AI-driven enterprise.
Leaders must craft a vision that aligns core competencies — product innovation, customer 
success, data management and ecosystem partnerships — with AI capabilities, while 
ensuring accountability for execution and outcomes. Leadership accountability is critical to 
ensure that the vision translates into measurable impact. Leaders should actively engage with 
ecosystem players, fostering collaboration to strengthen AI strategies. By uniting teams across 
engineering, product and data science, and focusing on market leadership and customer experience 
innovation, leaders can drive alignment and ensure measurable impact from AI initiatives.
Design an AI strategy that aligns with core competencies 
and unlocks value

•	
Define a unified AI vision and strategy
Insurers must articulate a clear, organization-wide 
vision for AI, tied to specific, actionable outcomes. 
This ensures all teams understand how AI initiatives 
contribute to customer-centric goals, such as tailored 
policy offerings or faster claims resolution.
•	
Establish cross-functional collaboration
Breaking down silos between underwriting, claims 
and product teams is essential for aligning AI with 
innovation goals. Cross-functional teams focused on 
value streams enable insurers to develop AI solutions 
that enhance operational efficiency and customer 
satisfaction.
•	
Implement measurable objectives and key 
results (OKRs)
Insurers should adopt performance measurement 
frameworks that include objectives and key results 
to track AI’s success. Key performance metrics 
should link to strategic business outcomes such as 
customer retention, underwriting efficiency or claims 
satisfaction, ensuring progress remains aligned with 
organizational goals.
Key actions
In addition to implementing AI to support various business 
processes […] we also rolled out AI and data training academies 
for our employees to educate and create a cultural shift 
towards using the technology in a mindful, responsible and 
knowledgeable way.

and regulations that is yet to come. And for 
any serious business that wants to invest 
in this technology and start developing this 
technology, they need to put aside some 
of that money and start getting involved 
working with the government and AI groups, 
to help form some of these regulations and to 
understand the ethics around it.
Chief Technology Officer — UK
As insurers advance through the three phases of AI 
adoption, the risks and potential for reputational damage 
grow exponentially. Governance, ethics and compliance 
are critical to maintaining stakeholder trust and ensuring 
AI unlocks its transformative potential.
Build trust into 
your roadmap 
2
•	
Establish robust AI governance 
frameworks
Insurers should implement comprehensive 
AI governance structures that set clear 
standards for accountability, transparency 
and compliance. These frameworks should 
define roles and responsibilities, establish 
protocols for monitoring AI performance and 
proactively address risks such as algorithmic 
accountability and ethical considerations.
•	
Embed ethical and bias-detection 
mechanisms
Ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in 
AI systems is essential. Insurers should 
develop tools to continuously audit AI 
models for unintended biases, especially 
in sensitive areas like underwriting and 
claims adjudication. This requires diverse, 
representative datasets and regular model 
testing, with independent oversight from 
ethics boards to enhance credibility and 
compliance.
•	
Prioritize privacy by design
Given the vast amount of customer data 
insurers manage, integrating privacy 
considerations into every stage of AI 
development is crucial. Adopting a “privacy by 
design” approach can ensure compliance with 
regulations like GDPR while building customer 
trust. This includes implementing encryption, 
anonymization and secure data-sharing 
practices as standard.
•	
Invest in security and resilience
AI systems in insurance are attractive targets 
for cyberattacks, such as model poisoning 
or adversarial attacks. Insurers should invest 
in advanced security measures, including 
real-time anomaly detection, regular defense 
updates and staff training to address emerging 
threats. Resilience ensures AI systems can 
operate reliably even during disruptions.

Key considerations
I think the challenge is investments in 
infrastructure, and the impact of having to 
re-architect our cloud environment every year 
or so to keep up with these massive shifts or 
when new aspects of AI technology come 
out. That’s a risk because it’s so expensive. 
We need to be able to anticipate whether we 
are built for the future. 
Director of AI Strategy — US
Create sustainable technology and data 
infrastructure for AI adoption 
3
Insurers should adopt disciplined investment strategies 
in technology and data management to balance 
experimentation with scalable returns. “No-regret” 
foundational investments will provide the infrastructure 
for long-term innovation, regardless of how AI evolves.
Key actions
•	
Invest in scalable and flexible 
infrastructure
Insurers should build a cloud-native 
infrastructure capable of supporting AI’s 
dynamic needs. Platforms for machine 
learning operations enable efficient 
deployment and lifecycle management, 
ensuring flexibility as AI initiatives grow.
•	
Establish comprehensive data 
management practices
High-quality, unified data is essential for 
effective AI. Insurers should invest in 
advanced data platforms that consolidate 
siloed datasets into a single source of truth. 
Tools for data quality, lineage and security 
ensure AI models are reliable and adaptable to 
evolving business needs.
•	
Focus on modular and interoperable 
solutions
Future-proofing technology stacks with 
modular AI systems ensures integration with 
existing tools and emerging innovations. Open 
APIs and vendor-agnostic solutions allow 
insurers to experiment without locking into 
restrictive ecosystems.
•	
Create a balanced investment 
portfolio
Insurers should pair foundational investments, 
like governance frameworks and infrastructure, 
with controlled experimentation in emerging 
AI technologies such as generative AI or real-
time risk assessment tools. This dual strategy 
can ensure immediate value while staying 
adaptable to future advancements.

Key considerations
There is an issue with trying to get more 
people to use [AI]. We have a challenge of 
finding good people with the right skill sets to 
help improve and build our models better. 
Chief Technology Officer — Japan
Build a culture that uses AI to uplift 
human potential
Human expertise remains indispensable alongside 
AI-driven automation. Attracting top talent in AI and 
machine learning is one of the most pressing challenges for 
the insurance sector, given the increasing global demand 
for these specialists. To meet this challenge, companies 
should not only recruit the best but also focus on upskilling 
and reskilling their existing workforce. Investing in robust 
learning and development programs ensures employees 
stay ahead of the curve as technology evolves. Such efforts 
are critical to building internal expertise and fostering a 
workforce capable of adapting to new AI capabilities. 
•	
Foster transformational leadership
Leadership should champion AI by fostering 
trust, transparency and collaboration. Leaders 
should actively communicate AI’s role as an 
enabler of growth and innovation, empowering 
teams to experiment and embrace change.
•	
Build an AI-literate workforce
Insurers should create tailored learning 
programs to equip employees with the skills 
needed to thrive in an AI-driven environment. 
Training should extend beyond technical 
teams, ensuring all employees understand AI’s 
implications for their roles.
•	
Address cultural resistance through 
change management
Overcoming cultural resistance requires clear 
communication, active employee engagement 
and support systems. Insurers should address 
fears of job displacement by demonstrating 
how AI augments roles, builds skills and 
improves efficiency, fostering buy-in through 
co-created solutions.
•	
Redefine roles and career pathways
AI will likely reshape roles within insurance, 
shifting employees toward higher-value 
activities like customer engagement and 
strategic decision-making. Insurers should 
clearly map these new career opportunities 
and establish roles like AI ethics officers or 
value-stream leaders to align human expertise 
with AI capabilities.

To gain a broad understanding of how leaders are 
navigating the opportunities and challenges of 
implementing AI, KPMG International conducted a robust 
research program involving multiple methodologies. 
This included in-depth interviews with eight AI experts 
spanning technology, government regulation and 
industry, as well as discussions with sector-specific 
KPMG specialists. Qualitative research was conducted 
to uncover nuanced, industry-specific challenges and 
opportunities, such as insights from several industry 
experts, including Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University, 
a renowned authority on AI and digital transformation. 
The research was further strengthened by a quantitative 
survey of 1,390 decision-makers across key global 
markets, including 183 respondents from the insurance 
sector. These leaders shared their experiences and 
perspectives on overcoming barriers to AI adoption, from 
dismantling legacy systems to addressing organizational 
inertia. In parallel, an 18-month research project evaluated 
the realistic value at stake for fully deploying and adopting 
generative AI. Together, these inputs offer a clear 
roadmap for organizations to unlock AI’s potential and 
drive meaningful, enterprise-wide change.

Kindly Note :- Relative importance of pillars are mapped as “Weightage” whereas the segment’s ability to fulfil the experience requirements is mentioned as “Ability to fulfil”
Expectation (25 per cent) and Integrity (19 per cent) are the key pillars of experience for electricity consumers
Meeting customer expectation, directly impacts satisfaction –
Delivering on the integrity pillar, ensures high chances of the customers engaging in additional offerings by the DISCOM
An individual’s willingness to pay a premium is driven by immediate needs. As today’s customer evolves, the focal aspects of premiumisation has shifted from functionality to experience. These aspect may as well translate as personalised communication, omnichannel access to services or even responsive customer support.

To address these challenges, KPMG introduces the three phases of AI value — a framework designed to guide banks through the AI adoption journey. This phased approach provides a structured roadmap, helping banks prioritize investments, align initiatives with business goals, and position themselves effectively in the age of AI in banking.
The Enable phase focuses on enabling people and building AI foundations. Organisations appoint a responsible executive, create an AI strategy, identify high-value use cases, boost AI literacy, align with regulations and establish ethical guardrails. AI pilots are launched across functions, while cloud platforms and pre-trained models are leveraged with minimal customisation.
The Embed phase integrates AI into workflows, products, services, value streams, robotics, and wearables, delivering greater value. A senior leader drives enterprise-wide workforce redesign, re-skilling and change, embedding AI into operating models with a focus on ethics, trust and security. AI agents and diverse models are deployed, supported by cloud and legacy tech modernisation, while enterprise-wide data enhances operations.
The Evolve phase evolves business models and ecosystems, using AI and frontier technologies like quantum computing and blockchain to solve large sector-wide challenges. AI orchestrates seamless value across enterprises and partners. Emphasizing ethics and trust with real-time security, this phase uplifts human potential with broad and deep workforce training, fostering a creative, innovative and value-driven future.

Intelligent banking: A blueprint for creating value through AI-driven transformation | 2
This report is the result of extensive research into 
the value being created by artificial intelligence (AI) 
within the banking sector. It is designed to provide 
actionable insights for leaders at every stage of 
their AI journey, from those deploying their first 
pilots to banks seeking to scale enterprise-wide 
AI initiatives. 
While some banks are highly advanced in their use of 
AI, many others face significant barriers that impede 
progress. Moving beyond tests and pilots is no longer an 
option — it is an imperative. This report serves as a guide 
to help banks navigate this critical transition and unlock 
AI’s transformative potential.
Banks are beginning to grapple with the reality that seizing 
the significant opportunities AI presents will require far 
more than just an investment in technology. It demands a 
holistic rethinking of strategy, culture, operation practices 
and an ethical framework for deployment.
Yet, many find themselves stalled by inertia. Long-term 
value is difficult to define, and many organizations 
struggle with setting clear objectives, identifying key 
performance indicators (KPIs) and proving return on 
investment (ROI). These challenges are compounded by 
the costs of technology upgrades, implementation risks 
and hesitations among senior executives who are eager 
to transform but cautious about leading the charge.
To prepare for an intelligent enterprise, banks should 
embrace AI as a driver of sustainable growth. By 
integrating AI across functions — from marketing 
and customer service to fraud prevention and risk 
management — banks can create innovative, customer-
centric solutions that not only enhance profitability but 
also deepen customer loyalty. This report provides the 
tools and insights needed to break through barriers, 
scale AI adoption and position banks to succeed in an 
increasingly competitive and intelligent future.
Foreword
AI is not just a technology investment 
for banks — it’s a catalyst for 
redefining strategy, operations and 
culture. To unlock its potential, banks 
must overcome inertia, embrace 
transformation and integrate AI as 
a core enabler of customer-centric, 
sustainable growth.

Introduction
Banks are increasingly experimenting with 
generative AI in isolated use cases, such as chatbots, 
content creation and personalized marketing. 
However, many are struggling to extract meaningful 
value from these efforts. Our study finds that while 
many financial institutions see AI as critical to their 
future, and beginning to realize efficiencies, only a 
small fraction report achieving revenue growth from 
their AI investments. 
Banks face unique challenges
Many struggle to establish a risk environment robust 
enough to support broader AI deployment, particularly in 
highly regulated areas like credit decisioning or compliance 
monitoring. Concerns about data governance, operational 
integrity and regulatory scrutiny create barriers to 
progress. At the same time, the rapid pace of technological 
advancements — combined with the competitive dynamics 
of proprietary versus open-source AI platforms — adds 
complexity, leaving banks uncertain about how to scale 
their efforts.
Banks embrace the new world of AI agents
AI agents are set to transform banking by enabling 
hyper-personalized, efficient and seamless customer 
experiences while driving operational efficiency.
These intelligent agents can act as 24/7 virtual advisors, 
providing tailored financial guidance, automating routine 
transactions and proactively managing customer 
needs based on real-time data and predictive insights. 
In operations, AI agents can streamline back-office 
processes, such as fraud detection, compliance 
monitoring, and risk assessment, by analyzing vast 
amounts of data with unmatched speed and precision. 
A blueprint for value
To overcome these challenges, seize the opportunity and 
prepare for the next generation of AI technologies, banks 
should adopt a deliberate, structured approach to AI 
adoption. In this report we introduce the three phases of 
AI value — a framework designed to help banks prioritize 
efforts, align investments and realize the full potential of AI.

Key considerations
Preparing for an AI future
Guiding your AI transformation
Introduction
Four key considerations that will likely accelerate AI adoption and the creation of long-term value:
Design an AI strategy that aligns 
with core competencies and 
unlocks value
Banks should establish a bold vision for 
AI that aligns with their core strengths. 
This vision should guide a transformation 
roadmap that redefines how AI drives 
growth and innovation while holding 
teams accountable for results. Aligning AI 
deployments with strategic goals — such 
as improving fraud detection, streamlining 
underwriting and enhancing customer 
personalization — can help maximize ROI.
Build trust into the 
transformation roadmap
AI in banking introduces unique risks that 
can undermine trust, meaning proactive 
risk management is critical from the 
outset. Banks should address data privacy 
and security challenges, helping ensure 
compliance with financial regulations 
while protecting sensitive customer 
information. Combating algorithmic bias 
and adopting explainable AI systems 
that regulators, customers, and internal 
stakeholders can trust is critical.
Create sustainable technology 
and data infrastructure for AI 
adoption
Data is a critical strategic asset and 
the foundation for all AI initiatives. 
Banks should build a robust data 
governance framework, focusing on 
quality, integration and security, while 
also creating a foundation for long-term 
scalability. This includes investing in 
enterprise-grade AI infrastructure that 
can support high volumes of transactions, 
complex risk models and real-time 
decision-making. ​ 
Build a culture that uses AI to 
uplift human potential
A multifaceted talent strategy that 
balances retention with upskilling is 
a key priority. Academic institutions, 
fintech startups and innovation hubs can 
inject fresh perspectives and enhance 
workforce capabilities. Immersive AI 
training programs help to drive innovation 
in customer experiences and operational 
models, diversify hiring pipelines and 
enable transformative outcomes.​

Current state
Banks are actively exploring and refining strategies to deploy AI. Amid 
foundational and talent readiness challenges, the banking sector is cautiously 
yet innovatively adopting AI, employing diverse implementation strategies and 
integrating complementary technologies to transform key business functions.
AI is no longer just a futuristic concept in banking — it’s already driving innovation in 
critical areas such as fraud detection, personalization and risk management. Leading 
global institutions are at the forefront, using AI to transform key processes and deliver 
enhanced customer experiences. These banks have identified hundreds of AI use cases, 
from streamlining operations to offering hyper-personalized products and services. 
However, for other banks the research highlights a number of inhibiting factors.
The foundational infrastructure is still in development
Banks face a challenge in building the critical infrastructure necessary to support scalable 
AI solutions. Only 25 percent have enterprise-wide cloud or hybrid-cloud platforms 
strategically supporting data-driven services, leaving many banks struggling to lay the 
groundwork for effective AI adoption.
Leaders and employees are just coming to grips with AI’s potential
Sixty-one percent of banks provide ethics and guardrails training for AI, helping 
employees navigate the responsible application of the technology. However, in-depth AI 
training remains limited, with only 30 percent offering advanced content that fosters a 
comprehensive understanding of AI capabilities.
Our organization is still in an experimental stage 
with respect to AI. We’ve not yet established any 
clear objectives or KPIs around how it’s used.

Introduction
At a glance
Barriers to progress
Making substantive progress is complicated by:
Significant concerns over AI risks and ethics
AI adoption in banking is accompanied by widespread 
concern about risks and ethical implications. 
Seventy-one percent of leaders agree that establishing 
robust frameworks for regulatory compliance is essential 
to ensure responsible AI implementation. 
Balancing AI adoption with sustainability 
objectives
However, balancing sustainability goals with AI initiatives 
poses a challenge, as 70 percent struggle to reconcile 
AI’s energy usage with their environmental objectives and 
66 percent view meeting sustainability goals as a higher 
strategic priority than implementing AI. 
Data is a significant barrier
The quality of data remains a major obstacle for banks 
seeking to scale AI adoption, with 72 percent expressing 
concerns about data quality. Without consistent, reliable 
and accessible data, banks face challenges in building 
accurate and effective AI models, stalling progress 
toward meaningful AI-driven transformation.
The biggest challenge right now is regulatory requirements and specific regulators 
for authorities from different locations from Spain, Germany, UK. They all have their 
different requirements and expectations. 
Chief Compliance Officer — Germany
Bankers are taking a wait-and-see approach
The rapid evolution of AI technologies is creating 
uncertainty and hesitation among banking leaders. 
Seventy-one percent believe it is best to wait for the 
AI tech landscape to stabilize before making significant 
investments, while 57 percent feel overwhelmed by the 
sheer volume of information and hype surrounding AI. 
AI expertise is limited
A lack of specialized AI expertise is also holding banks 
back, with only 19 percent guided by highly specialized 
AI teams driving strategy across the organization. In 
addition, just 18 percent use AI as a core driver for 
product and service development across multiple areas. 
Accuracy
Accuracy is a significant inhibitor to scaling AI in banking, 
as the highly regulated financial sector demands strict 
compliance with risk and regulatory requirements, 
leaving little room for error. Without mechanisms to 
ensure AI outputs are consistently accurate, repeatable 
and explainable, banks face the challenge of balancing 
innovation with the need for human oversight, which can 
slow down adoption and limit scalability.
Moving forward
It’s clear that bankers face a complex web of challenges 
as they navigate AI adoption. Despite significant efforts 
to implement AI, these fragmented strategies and limited 
readiness illustrate the need for a more structured approach.
In this report we introduce the three phases of AI value 
creation which is an organizational framework designed to 
help banks progress from isolated foundational capabilities 
to enterprise-wide innovation. By building trust, aligning 
strategies, enabling technology and empowering their 
workforce, banks can unlock AI’s transformative potential 
while mitigating risks. This framework not only offers an 
approach for successful adoption but also helps ensure 
that AI becomes a sustainable, strategic enabler for 
long-term growth and value.

Enterprise
This layer orchestrates transformational change of the whole enterprise, starting 
with how AI can adjust strategy, business models and key objectives for the 
enterprise. It defines enterprise-wide operating model shifts, workforce evolution 
and risks and controls. This layer prioritizes AI transformation initiatives into a 
roadmap and runs a transformation office to help manage funding, track benefits 
and adjust priorities dynamically to help maximize the value delivered.
Functions
This layer drives AI-enabled transformation across business functions, prioritizing 
customer-facing value streams and end-to-end enabling processes and workflows, 
which enhance the flow of value. AI applications, agents and robotics are 
embedded in the workflows. Functional operating model changes are delivered to 
realize potential benefits.
Foundations
This layer establishes the AI-first technology stack, including infrastructure, cloud 
and choices on chips. High-quality enterprise data needs to be curated and diverse 
models are likely to be deployed to handle domain-specific AI and support the 
adoption of AI agents. An increased focus on cybersecurity for AI is needed as well 
as a plan for other emerging technology, such as quantum.
Successfully implementing AI in an organization involves a strategic approach to 
building capability across foundational, functional and enterprise layers. Establishing 
a transformation management office is also crucial for aligning AI strategy, 
value orchestration and project delivery across all layers. The body coordinates 
initiatives, establishes standards and best practices, and facilitates cross-functional 
collaboration to drive accountability and enterprise-wide value.

Enable
The Enable phase focuses on enabling people and 
building AI foundations. Organizations appoint a 
responsible executive, create an AI strategy, identify 
high-value use cases, boost AI literacy, align with 
regulations and establish ethical guardrails. AI pilots 
are launched across functions, while cloud platforms 
and pre-trained models are leveraged with minimal 
customization.
Embed
The Embed phase integrates AI into workflows, 
products, services, value streams, robotics and 
wearables, delivering greater value. A senior leader 
drives enterprise-wide workforce redesign, re-skilling 
and change, embedding AI into operating models with 
a focus on ethics, trust and security. AI agents and 
diverse models are deployed, supported by cloud and 
legacy tech modernization, while enterprise-wide data 
enhances operations.
Evolve
The Evolve phase evolves business models and 
ecosystems, using AI and frontier technologies like 
quantum computing and blockchain to solve large 
sector-wide challenges. AI can orchestrate seamless 
value across enterprises and partners. Emphasizing 
ethics and trust with real-time security, this phase 
uplifts human potential with broad and deep 
workforce training, fostering a creative, innovative 
and value-driven future.
A company may have a portfolio of initiatives aimed at any level (of the operating model) within each phase. The ratio of effort and investment across the phases will vary as the 
organization matures. Initially, most resources will focus on phase one, with a small effort to explore enterprise-wide transformation. Over time, as foundational efficiencies are 
realized more effort is invested in phase two, while, with an eye on the future, long-term investments in phase three start to lay the groundwork for transformative innovation. This 
dynamic balancing act ensures banks can achieve immediate results while setting themselves up in the right way for future success.
The journey to become an intelligent bank
Effective AI-enabled transformation goes beyond technology implementation. By examining leading practice, we have 
identified that banks can increase capability and value across three phases of AI transformation. 
This provides a structured yet flexible framework for navigating the complexities of AI adoption. It balances the need 
for short-term efficiency gains with the imperative to prepare for future growth and innovation. It helps banks prioritize 
their efforts, allocate resources effectively, build capability and align their AI initiatives with both short-term goals and 
long-term strategic objectives.

Phases of the 
AI journey
Focusing on maturity across the three phases — 
Enable, Embed and Evolve — is critical for 
sustained value creation. It requires increasing 
the maturity of the capabilities that are vital to 
the foundations, functions and enterprise layers 
simultaneously. 
At the enterprise layer, increased AI maturity involves 
orchestrating AI across functions to enable enterprise-
wide innovation and strategic alignment. Without a 
balanced focus on all three layers, organizations risk 
missing opportunities for transformation.
At the functions layer, AI should be embedded into 
key value streams, optimizing specific processes and 
creating improved outcomes, such as more compelling 
products and services and more engaging, end-to-end 
employee and customer experiences.
At the foundations layer, organizations should build up 
the new AI-first technology stack, through a process 
of technology modernization. Infrastructure, data, 
models and applications can all become optimized for 
delivery of AI.

Consequently, most banks focus on reducing costs and 
increasing efficiency. AI automates repetitive, manual 
processes, which can help streamline operations and 
minimize human error. For example:
Fraud detection and prevention: Several banks 
are using AI to analyze transactional data in real time, 
identifying patterns indicative of fraud. This automation 
not only reduces the workload for fraud analysts but 
also enhances accuracy and speed, minimizing financial 
losses. For instance, in 2023, a major credit card 
company thwarted 80 million fraudulent transactions 
worth $40 billion globally, attributing this success to 
substantial investments in AI technology.1
Document processing: A major US bank uses AI to 
review and analyze thousands of legal documents in 
seconds. This task previously required hundreds of 
hours of manual labor, significantly reducing costs and 
human error.
Loan underwriting: AI-driven automation is resulting in 
faster and more accurate loan underwriting decisions. At 
one global bank, AI-based underwriting has reduced loan 
processing cycle times from 30 to 16 days, effectively 
doubling underwriting efficiency. By analyzing vast 
amounts of customer data, including credit history, 
income patterns and risk indicators, AI models identify 
and assess creditworthiness with speed and precision, 
enabling faster decision-making while minimizing errors.2

AI is changing the customer 
experience in banking
AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are 
revolutionizing customer service by providing instant 
responses to common queries, transaction searches and 
account management tasks. First-generation chatbots 
are being upgraded to conversational, contextually aware 
chatbots that emulate human interactions. These tools 
reduce wait times and allow customers to access support 
24/7, offering convenience and reliability. Similarly, 
AI-driven personalization engines analyze transaction 
history, spending patterns and demographics to deliver 
tailored product recommendations, such as suggesting 
relevant credit card offers or savings plans. 
As mentioned, AI also improves customer experience by 
enhancing transaction security and reducing fraud. HSBC, 
for example, uses AI to detect fraud across millions of 
accounts, providing customers with a sense of security 
and trust. These innovations make everyday banking 
more seamless, secure and customer-centric, laying 
the groundwork for deeper engagement and loyalty in 
later stages.
Banks are leveraging AI to revolutionize know your 
customer (KYC) processes, improving efficiency, accuracy 
and compliance. AI-powered tools automate identity 
verification, analyze vast datasets to detect anomalies 
When we started leveraging AI, 
especially for some of our solutions, 
usually for the customer enrolment 
process, we acquired many customers 
through the chatbot system, which 
resulted in more revenue.

and flag potential risks in real time, significantly reducing 
the time and cost associated with traditional KYC checks. 
Machine learning algorithms enhance fraud detection 
by identifying patterns of suspicious activity that may 
go unnoticed by manual processes. Additionally, natural 
language processing (NLP) enables banks to extract and 
verify critical information from unstructured documents, 
such as passports and utility bills, with precision. By 
integrating AI into KYC, banks can strengthen regulatory 
compliance and also enhance the customer experience 
through faster, frictionless onboarding.

AI and the employee experience
For employees, AI in the first phase automates repetitive processes such as data 
entry, document verification and compliance checks, reducing errors and freeing 
up employees to focus on customers. This not only increases efficiency but also 
reduces the mental fatigue associated with repetitive, manual work. 
AI tools also act as cognitive assistants, supporting employees with real-time 
insights and help with decision-making. Relationship managers and call center 
agents are using AI-driven dashboards that provide personalized customer 
information, such as financial goals or recent inquiries, allowing for more meaningful 
and informed interactions. Additionally, predictive analytics help employees 
anticipate customer needs, enabling proactive outreach and tailored solutions.
By minimizing administrative burdens and empowering employees, AI can help 
banks deliver better customer experiences.
AI will change the way we hire people, from the number of staff 
that are required to do certain functions, the types of staff and 
the number of people in certain roles. I don’t think there’ll be 
less staff, but I just think they’ll be doing different things.

A major German bank
Case study
The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) at a major German bank shared insights into its journey toward AI adoption. The bank applies AI in key areas like anti-money laundering, fraud 
detection and compliance monitoring, aiming to streamline processes such as transaction monitoring and KYC.
Current AI usage 
Experimentation without a cohesive AI strategy 
The bank’s current AI usage is fragmented. Although individual teams are 
independently experimenting with AI tools such as Copilot in Power BI 
and Gen AI, the bank does not have a cohesive organizational AI strategy. 
Despite this decentralized implementation, AI has proven instrumental 
in enhancing efficiency, particularly by programmers who are using it to 
streamline coding, or for data processing by the data analytics teams. 
This has saved the teams significant time on repetitive tasks. 
Initially hesitant to adopt AI, the bank has since transitioned into 
a cautious integration phase, acknowledging the technology’s 
transformative potential while remaining mindful of associated risks.
Challenges 
Navigating regulatory, technical 
and human hurdles in AI adoption 
The bank faces several challenges in its 
AI adoption, including meeting stringent 
regulatory requirements for explaining how 
AI decisions are made, which are critical for 
compliance. 
In addition, the CCO notes that legacy 
systems and data silos create technical 
barriers that hinder seamless integration, 
while a lack of staff expertise hinders 
the effective evaluation and utilization of 
AI outputs.
Outlook 
Leaders expect to be more 
agile and open-minded as 
they embrace AI’s potential
The bank’s journey mirrors industry 
trends and the struggle of balancing 
AI’s potential with regulatory and 
workplace challenges. Although the 
respondent mentions that a unified 
AI strategy is expected by mid-2025, 
they highlight the need for 
leaders to become more agile and 
experimental to drive AI innovation 
and guide AI usage responsibly.

Making a step change in regulatory compliance with Gen AI
Case study
Client challenge
KPMG’s client, a leading global banking group 
serving over 21 million customers offers a 
wide range of banking, insurance and asset 
management services to individuals, businesses 
and institutional clients.
The risk team, however, has struggled to 
find an efficient way to navigate and comply 
with 17 separate regulations that involve over 
2,000 regulatory requirements across over 
1,600 pages. 
The team faced difficulties in comparing the most 
recent version of the regulations with previous 
versions of regulations and drawing synthetic 
opinions efficiently. The manual process required 
a significant amount of time and effort and has led 
to concerns related to potential compliance risks.
Our approach
Professionals from a KPMG member firm analyzed 
the available AI solutions on the market and built a 
customized Gen AI chatbot. 
This technology solution operates on a “chat-with-
document” logic, which means that changes to 
policy documents can be visualized, reducing the 
time it takes for employees to review and compare 
documents and extract specific information.
It integrates relevant banking regulations and 
produced responses through pre-defined prompts 
and precise questioning.
A proof of concept (POC) was developed initially to 
demonstrate the model’s capability to learn from 
a closed set of regulatory documents that were 
overseen by human experts to mitigate risks.
Value delivered
The Gen AI chatbot solution demonstrated the 
potential to shift from a primarily manual review 
process to an AI-assisted approach that reduces 
time, effort and risk.
Thirty-six regulatory compliance evaluation cases 
within the POC were tested and validated the 
model’s high confidence level in generating the 
expected results.
It represents the first step in an evolutionary 
path for the technology, including extending 
it to all relevant regulations, comparative 
analyses and integration into the bank’s cost 
optimization system.

Second phase
The focus is on breaking down silos, redesigning the ways banks unlock more complex 
value opportunities in the second phase. AI becomes embedded across the bank’s 
core functions, enabling dynamic decision-making, real-time insights and predictive 
personalization.
Shared data platforms foster collaboration and a culture of agility and innovation. 
Customer satisfaction scores, cross-sell effectiveness, and speed-to-market join 
efficiency and cost reduction as key metrics of success.
Banks also need to prepare for agentic AI, which is rapidly evolving in capability. Initially, 
macros (simple, rule-based agents) operate on data tasks like credit scoring and fraud 
detection. As banks advance, software (platform-based) agents will be configured to 
handle more complex, context-aware tasks, acting as semi-autonomous assistants. 
Banks should build shared data platforms for use by deterministic AI or true agents 
built on ‘large action models’ that can independently assess risks, design products and 
optimize entire value streams like loan processing.
This can drive a paradigm shift in how a bank’s workforce is shaped, where employees 
go from traditional roles to becoming managers of AI agents, treating these systems as 
complex cognitive co-workers. In this model, employees are no longer merely task executors 
but orchestrators of AI-driven workflows, overseeing and optimizing the performance of 
advanced AI agents capable of handling complex, context-aware operations.
We use AI to help us accelerate development, speed up time to 
market, production cycles and project life cycles… I think it will help 
us to drive revenue.

disbursement, servicing and eventually, closure.
Onboarding and account opening: This journey begins when a 
customer first engages with the bank, opening an account, going 
through compliance checks and receiving initial financial services. 
Fraud prevention: This stream spans the entire banking system, 
integrating real-time fraud detection, risk mitigation and customer 
protection activities into one seamless process. 
Payment processing: Covering a wide range of activities, this 
stream involves domestic and cross-border transactions, payment 
approvals, reconciliation and real-time tracking of funds. 
Customer retention and growth: This focuses on the continuous 
engagement with a customer over their financial lifecycle, including 
personalized advice, loyalty programs and customer satisfaction 
management.

Barriers to realizing value
Banks should address critical foundational activities early on, as failing to do so can 
stall progress. Key barriers include an incomplete vision for the future operating 
model, outdated foundational and technology infrastructure, and inadequate 
governance frameworks to mitigate risks and uphold ethical standards. 
Equally vital is securing the buy-in of leaders and employees by demonstrating AI’s 
transformative potential. Specific areas for focus include:
Lack of trust 
As AI becomes integral to processes, banks face increasing pressure to maintain 
transparency and trust, both internally and externally. Scaling AI without robust 
frameworks for accountability and explainability can lead to mistrust among 
employees, customers and regulators.
Managing strategy implementation
Scaling and embedding AI across the organization requires a profound transformation 
of structures and leadership. Most banks are historically organized around products 
such as credit cards, mortgages or savings accounts, with each function operating 
in silos. Moving to value streams disrupts these legacy structures, requiring 
processes that cut across departments and focus on end-to-end customer journeys. 
Change management becomes a critical task, as banks must not only roll out new 
technologies but also foster acceptance of new workflows and cultural norms. Poorly 
managed transitions risk low adoption of AI tools, employee dissatisfaction and 
stalled transformation efforts.

Workforce concerns
Many banks lack the in-house expertise to meet 
AI’s demands. This talent gap slows the pace of 
transformation, as banks struggle to upskill employees 
or hire specialized professionals, but upskilling and talent 
acquisition are only part of the battle, this shift often 
encounters resistance from teams and leaders aligned to 
specific products, slowing the adoption of value stream 
approaches. For instance, aligning risk, operations and 
customer service into a single value stream like “home 
ownership” can create tensions as functions adjust to 
new ways of working.
The transformation also has significant implications for 
employees and organizational structures. Many roles will 
evolve as automation reduces the need for routine tasks, 
requiring employees to shift to higher-value activities, such 
as oversight and strategic decision-making. This creates 
uncertainty among staff, who may fear losing relevance: A 
2024 KPMG global customer experience excellence study 
found that younger employees in particular are worried 
that entry level jobs will no longer exist because of AI.3 
Early wins are needed to generate momentum.
Leadership also plays a pivotal role in this transition. 
Scaling AI demands leaders who can break down silos, 
I think the biggest challenge is people’s 
adoption and having a common 
understanding of the tech. I think that’s 
the biggest one, readiness. Then, the 
change management piece is always 
a journey.

align cross-functional teams, and foster a culture of 
experimentation and collaboration. However, traditional 
leadership styles in banking, often hierarchical and 
risk-averse, are not always equipped for these demands. 
Leaders must champion value streams and empower 
teams to innovate, even when this disrupts established 
practices. Without such transformational leadership, 
efforts to scale AI may falter.
The technology evolution
Significant investment is required to roll out new 
technologies that can support AI at scale. Banks must 
implement advanced machine learning platforms, real-
time analytics and scalable infrastructure like cloud 
computing. These investments may conflict with 
existing IT roadmaps and budgets, creating delays 
and prioritization challenges. Legacy issues also play a 
big role. Banks are increasingly turning to AI-enabled 
software re-engineering tools (such as Codeium) to 
tackle the challenges of legacy code and technical debt. 
These tools analyze, refactor and optimize outdated 
codebases, making them more efficient, secure and 
maintainable. They automate labor-intensive tasks like 
identifying redundant code, optimizing performance 
bottlenecks and modernizing code to align with current 
programming standards.

An American financial services company
Specializing in cash handling and manufacturing smart 
safes and point-of-sale equipment, Loomis, a US financial 
services company, employs 23,000 people across 
20 countries and generates US$3 billion annually. Chief 
Information Officer (CIO) Kendall Knight discussed how 
the organization uses AI to improve operations and create 
new business opportunities.
Current AI usage: Using AI for operational excellence 
and customer engagement
The organization employs Gen AI and machine learning to 
solve operational and customer engagement challenges. 
Gen AI enhances response capabilities, personalizes 
customer interactions and provides 24/7 service. 
Machine learning applications include a software-as-a-
service (SaaS) offering that forecasts cash requirement 
for banks and credit unions, generating US$20 million 
annually. Internally, AI analyzes video and data patterns 
to detect internal theft, replacing manual processes and 
significantly improving efficiency. 
Challenges: Overcoming expertise, compliance and 
innovation challenges in AI adoption
Identifying meaningful use cases, ensuring compliance 
with strict banking regulations, data governance and 
privacy, and overcoming legacy system constraints are 
challenges. Loomis initially lacked in-house expertise, 
so it relied on external consultants and freelance data 
scientists to implement pilot programs. Business leaders 
are still developing their understanding of AI’s capabilities 
and limitations.
Organization’s AI outlook: Scaling AI across 
departments to drive competitive advantage
Looking ahead, Knight envisions broader AI adoption 
across departments, enabling efficiencies in areas 
like finance, human resources and operations. The 
company expects significant changes in leadership roles, 
emphasizing the need for cross-functional AI knowledge.

The Evolve phase transforms enterprises to adapt to market 
disruptions, forming new business models and ecosystems 
to solve larger, industry-wide problems. Companies establish 
and orchestrate ecosystems with customers, suppliers and 
governments, orchestrated by AI to deliver seamless value. 
The third phase gives the biggest payoff. As AI enables costs to 
come down, some markets will grow, some decline, and new 
ones emerge. Invest in areas of price elasticity — things we can 
do more of with AI as costs decline. Your competitors may focus 
more on what is disappearing and risk being replaced.

AI-driven autonomous 
banking
AI takes full control of managing customer 
finances. AI-driven systems automatically 
manage account balances, optimize 
investment portfolios, and even adjust 
loan terms in real time based on market 
conditions and customer financial 
behavior. For example, a retail bank in the 
UK is experimenting with fully 
autonomous banking services that 
automatically transfer money between 
accounts based on real-time cash flow 
analysis.
AI-powered digital 
marketplaces
Leading banks are increasingly 
transforming into platform businesses, 
using AI to create digital ecosystems 
where customers can access a range of 
services from third-party providers. AI 
helps banks match customers with the 
most relevant products and services, 
whether it’s a mortgage from a partner 
bank or an insurance product from a 
fintech company. Ping An in China has 
already developed a comprehensive 
financial ecosystem, using AI to integrate 
insurance, banking and health services 
into a seamless customer experience.4 
Ping An reported over 202 billion Chinese 
Yuan Renminbi (RMB) in AI-driven product 
sales as a result of this approach.5
Blockchain and AI 
synergy
In the third phase, banks are exploring the 
intersection of AI and blockchain to 
enhance security, transparency and 
operational efficiency. By combining AI’s 
predictive power with the decentralized 
nature of blockchain, banks can offer more 
secure and efficient services, such as 
smart contracts that automatically execute 
agreements based on predefined 
conditions. J.P. Morgan’s Quorum 
blockchain platform integrates AI to create 
secure, transparent transactions in its 
trading and financial services.6
AI-driven predictive 
finance
In this phase, banks use AI to move 
from reactive to predictive finance, 
where AI not only helps customers 
manage their money but anticipates 
their needs and financial goals. Banks 
can offer predictive insights, such as 
when a customer might need a loan, 
helping them plan their financial future 
with precision.

Head of AI — Canada
Leading banks are already exhibiting third phase 
characteristics, creating and orchestrating new 
ecosystems. 
Banks can enhance their core offerings by integrating 
with partners in wealth management, health solutions 
and sustainability. Fintechs, tech giants and non-financial 
partners can help banks create a holistic ecosystem 
tailored to customer needs. For example, customers 
may access real-time financial insights alongside tailored 
investment recommendations, lifestyle perks or business 
analytics — all from a unified, AI-driven platform.
Ping An and BBVA have developed open banking 
platforms that allow third-party developers to create 
applications that integrate with its services.
Banking will likely also become deeply predictive and 
proactive. Instead of customers seeking financial 
services, the bank anticipates their needs and delivers 
services seamlessly at the right time, through the 
right channel. For example, AI-powered assistants 
may analyze spending patterns to suggest cost-saving 
measures or automatically optimize loan terms based on 
market conditions.
Financial services integrate invisibly into customers’ daily 
lives, embedded within other activities like shopping, 
traveling or running a business. AI can enable this by 
providing instant, contextual financial decisions in real 
time, without requiring active customer input.

European bank boosts customer insight analysis for product 
development with AI
Case study
Client challenge
KPMG’s client is a European bank specializing in 
serving small and medium enterprises. It has several 
brands, subsidiaries and associated banks. 
The client sought to gain a better understanding of 
customers’ perceptions and experiences to improve 
their products and services. 
Their primary challenge was the complexity of 
extracting actionable insights from the large volume 
of qualitative data collected through customer 
satisfaction surveys.
The objective was to gain detailed insight into 
customer sentiment toward the bank’s offerings, 
pinpointing satisfaction levels, areas of discontent and 
the general sentiment toward the bank.
Our approach
The KPMG team leveraged its OpenAI platform 
to conduct a detailed sentiment analysis of the 
customer satisfaction survey responses to extract 
actionable insights. 
With the help of Python, MS Excel and OpenAI, the 
KPMG team created and analyzed a large dataset 
of responses to generate an overview of customer 
sentiment. 
A close examination of the emotional content of the 
feedback allowed the range of customer emotions — 
from satisfied to disappointed — to be charted in 
detail. The bank recognized this as a strategic method 
for developing a deeper understanding of customer 
perception to allow targeted improvements that 
enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Value delivered
The analysis provided a refined understanding of 
overall customer sentiment, allowing the bank to 
identify areas of strength and opportunities for 
improvement. 
The AI implementation helped reduce response 
time for customer feedback from months to weeks 
through automated AI-driven analysis. It also provided 
a deeper level of analysis that had not previously 
been available. 
The use of Gen AI reduced the survey data analysis 
time by 75 percent, and reduced manual errors by 
5 percent. 
At a strategic level, the approach contributed to 
improved product and service offerings. As these 
improvements were based on customer feedback, 
they led to higher customer satisfaction levels 
and loyalty.

Four strategic actions
The research reveals that those organizations that are realizing the most value 
from their AI investments have focused on four strategic actions:
Leaders should craft a vision that aligns core competencies — product 
innovation, customer success, data management and ecosystem 
partnerships — with AI capabilities, while ensuring accountability for execution 
and outcomes. Leadership accountability is critical to help ensure that the 
vision translates into measurable impact. Leaders help actively engage with 
ecosystem players, fostering collaboration to strengthen AI strategies. By 
uniting teams across engineering, product and data science, and focusing 
on market leadership and customer experience innovation, leaders can drive 
alignment and ensure measurable impact from AI initiatives.
Design an AI strategy that aligns with core 
competencies and unlocks value
1
Source: [Title], KPMG International, 2025
•	
Define a unified AI vision and strategy
Leaders should articulate a clear, organization-wide vision for AI 
that aligns with the bank’s core competencies — such as product 
innovation, customer success and ecosystem partnerships. This vision 
should be specific, actionable, and tied to measurable outcomes, 
helping them to ensure that all teams understand how AI initiatives 
contribute to broader business goals. 
•	
Establish cross-functional collaboration
Before attempting to break down silos between engineering, product 
and data science teams, banks should baseline their infrastructure 
and operating model maturity to assess readiness for larger 
operating model transformation. Banks should create cross-functional 
teams focused on understanding where the bank can productize 
services, using AI to create new business model opportunities and 
fuel growth.
•	
Implement measurable objectives and key results (OKRs)
Banks should adopt robust performance measurement frameworks, 
such as OKRs, to track the effectiveness of the implementation of 
the strategy across the organization. These metrics should be tied 
to strategic business outcomes, such as revenue growth, customer 
satisfaction or market share. Regularly evaluating progress against 
these metrics helps ensure that AI initiatives remain aligned with the 
organization’s strategic priorities and provides a basis for iterative 
improvement.

Divisional Director — Australia
As banks advance across the three phases of AI adoption, 
the potential for risk and reputational damage grows 
exponentially. Governance, ethics and accurate data are 
critical to maintaining stakeholder trust and unlocking AI’s 
transformative potential.
Build trust into the 
transformation roadmap
•	
Establish robust AI governance
frameworks
Banks should implement comprehensive AI
governance structures that set clear standards for
accountability, transparency and compliance. This
includes defining roles and responsibilities across
teams, establishing protocols for monitoring AI
performance and creating mechanisms to address
risks such as algorithmic accountability and ethical
considerations proactively. Leaders and employees
need to trust the AI tools they are using if they are
to advocate their use to others.
•	
Embed ethical and bias-detection
mechanisms
Ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in AI systems
is essential. Banks should develop and deploy tools
that continuously audit AI models for unintended
biases, especially in sensitive applications like credit
decisioning or fraud detection. This requires diverse
and representative training datasets, regular model
testing and clear guidelines for acceptable model
outcomes. Collaborating with independent auditors
or ethics boards can provide additional oversight
and credibility.
•	
Prioritize privacy by design
As banks handle vast amounts of customer data,
integrating privacy considerations into every stage
of AI development is crucial. Adopting a ‘privacy by
design’ approach means implementing encryption,
anonymization and secure data-sharing practices as
standard. This helps ensure compliance with data
protection laws and builds trust with customers
and stakeholders.
•	
Invest in security and resilience
AI systems are increasingly attractive targets
for cyberattacks, including model poisoning
and adversarial attacks. Banks should focus on
eliminating the weakest links in the infrastructure
and invest in advanced security measures to
protect AI systems and underlying data. This
includes implementing real-time monitoring for
anomalies, regularly updating defenses and training
teams to respond to emerging threats. Building
resilience into AI systems helps ensure that they
can continue to function reliably even in the face of
disruptions or breaches.

3
Banks should balance the need for experimentation 
with the pursuit of scalable returns. As the AI landscape 
evolves, banks should make ‘no-regret’ investments 
looking for early wins that build momentum and can 
provide a solid foundation for future innovation — 
regardless of how the technology matures. 
•	
Invest in scalable and flexible infrastructure
Banks should build a robust, cloud-native 
infrastructure capable of supporting the dynamic 
needs of AI technologies. This includes adopting 
platforms that enable machine learning operations 
for efficient model deployment and lifecycle 
management. By focusing on scalable solutions, 
banks can help ensure they have the flexibility to 
expand AI initiatives as needs grow, avoiding the 
pitfalls of rigid, short-term fixes.
•	
Establish comprehensive data 
management practices
High-quality, unified data is the backbone of effective 
AI. Banks should prioritize investments in advanced 
data platforms that consolidate siloed datasets into a 
single source of truth, enabling seamless data access 
and governance. Implementing tools for data quality, 
lineage and security ensures AI models are built 
on reliable foundations and can adapt as regulatory 
requirements or business needs evolve. Banks should 
clean, organize and validate data to keep it free from 
inconsistencies, redundancies and biases that could 
undermine AI performance. Observability tools can 
monitor data health continuously, addressing potential 
issues before they impact AI outcomes.
•	
Focus on modular and interoperable 
solutions
To help future-proof their technology stack, 
banks should invest in modular AI systems 
that can integrate with existing tools and 
accommodate emerging technologies. 
Open APIs, interoperable software and 
vendor-agnostic solutions allow banks to 
experiment with new innovations without 
locking themselves into specific ecosystems. 
This approach helps ensure flexibility in 
responding to technological advancements.
•	
Create a balanced investment 
portfolio
Banks should adopt a dual strategy of 
no-regret foundational investments — such 
as infrastructure, data management and 
governance frameworks — paired with 
controlled experimentation in cutting-edge AI 
technologies like generative AI or autonomous 
systems. This balance helps ensure the 
organization can drive immediate value 
while remaining agile enough to adopt 
transformative innovations as they mature.

Divisional Director — Australia
Build a culture that uses AI to 
uplift human potential 
4
Human expertise remains indispensable alongside AI-driven 
automation. Attracting top talent in AI and machine learning 
is one of the most pressing challenges for the banking 
sector, given the increasing global demand for these 
specialists. To meet this challenge, companies should not 
only recruit the best but also focus on upskilling and reskilling 
their existing workforce. Investing in robust learning and 
development programs helps ensure employees stay ahead 
of the curve as technology evolves. Such efforts are critical 
to building internal expertise and fostering a workforce 
capable of adapting to new AI capabilities and opportunities.
•	
Foster transformational leadership
Leadership should evolve to champion AI adoption 
by fostering a culture of trust, transparency and 
collaboration. Leaders should actively communicate 
the strategic vision for AI, emphasizing its role as 
an enabler rather than a disruptor. Transformational 
leadership practices, such as empowering teams 
to experiment with AI, recognizing successes and 
addressing concerns openly, help build confidence 
and alignment across the organization. Leaders 
also need to model adaptability, demonstrating 
a willingness to embrace change and invest in 
their own AI knowledge to guide the organization 
effectively.
•	
Build an AI-literate workforce
Banks should create tailored learning programs that 
provide employees with a foundational understanding 
of AI, its applications and its implications for their 
roles. Upskilling should go beyond technical teams; 
employees across all functions, including operations, 
customer service and risk management, need 
to understand how AI impacts their work and 
enhances their decision-making capabilities. For 
technical roles, banks should provide specialized 
training in AI development, machine learning and 
data science to close the talent gap.
•	
Address cultural resistance through change 
management
Overcoming cultural resistance requires a structured 
change management approach that includes clear 
communication, employee engagement and support 
systems. Banks should proactively address fears around 
job displacement by emphasizing how AI can augment 
roles rather than replace them. Engaging employees in 
co-creating AI solutions fosters buy-in and helps ensure 
AI tools are designed with their practical needs in mind. 
Establishing forums for feedback, collaboration and 
success stories can help dispel misconceptions and 
create enthusiasm for AI-driven transformation.
•	
Redefine roles and career pathways
AI will likely fundamentally change the nature of work 
in banking, requiring a redefinition of roles and career 
pathways. Banks should identify areas where AI can 
automate routine tasks and shift employees toward 
higher-value activities, such as customer engagement, 
strategic analysis and innovation. Clearly mapping out 
these new career opportunities and pathways helps 
employees see AI as a means of growth rather than a 
threat. Additionally, banks should establish new roles, 
such as AI ethics officers or value-stream leaders, 
to align human expertise with AI capabilities to help 
ensure responsible implementation.

It has become a cliché to warn that banks must move 
quickly on AI or risk being left behind, but clichés often 
contain a grain of truth. Our research highlights a deeper 
tension: banks, inherently risk-averse institutions, currently 
perceive the risks of AI as outweighing its benefits. 
This hesitancy creates a significant barrier to progress. 
Banking executives face a dual imperative: they must 
simultaneously articulate the transformative potential of 
AI and address its associated risks in a way that inspires 
confidence across the organization.

Preparing for an AI future
AI is not a passing 
trend; it is an 
accelerating force 
that continues to 
evolve and disrupt.
The first step is to build a compelling case for AI’s 
long-term benefits, showing how it can fundamentally 
transform the business. This requires thinking beyond 
incremental efficiencies and envisioning a future where 
AI drives personalized customer experiences, optimizes 
risk management and enables entirely new business 
models. Leaders should engage in rigorous strategic 
analysis, including wargaming scenarios that explore how 
AI might reshape the competitive landscape. What will 
competitors do? How might non-banking entrants and 
tech companies encroach on traditional markets? What 
are the risks of inaction, such as losing customers to 
more agile rivals or being disintermediated by fintechs? 
Answering these questions should galvanize action, 
making the cost of doing nothing starkly clear.
At the same time, banks should confront the risks of 
AI head-on. Moving forward with AI as an enterprise-
wide asset requires robust frameworks for identifying, 
mitigating and monitoring risks. These include ethical 
concerns like bias, compliance challenges, security 
vulnerabilities and the operational risks inherent in relying 
on complex models. Leaders need to create a culture 
of transparency and build processes that surface risks 
early, with mechanisms to detect and address unknown 
risks as they emerge. Proactive risk management isn’t 
about eliminating uncertainty — it’s about managing it 
effectively enough to move forward with confidence.
AI is not a passing trend; it is an accelerating force that 
continues to evolve and disrupt. To navigate this reality, 
banks should take no-regrets actions — foundational 
investments in scalable infrastructure, data governance 
and AI-friendly operating models — that position them 
to capitalize on future breakthroughs. These actions can 
help ensure that when the technology advances, the bank 
is ready to integrate, adapt and thrive. Inaction is not an 
option; banks should balance the perceived risks with the 
transformative potential of AI to remain competitive and 
relevant in a rapidly changing financial landscape.

To gain a broad understanding of how leaders are 
navigating the opportunities and challenges of 
implementing AI, KPMG International conducted a robust 
research program involving multiple methodologies. 
This included in-depth interviews with eight AI experts 
spanning technology, government regulation and 
industry, as well as discussions with sector-specific 
KPMG specialists. Qualitative research was conducted 
to uncover nuanced, industry-specific challenges and 
opportunities, including insights from several industry 
experts, such as Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University, 
a renowned authority on AI and digital transformation.
The research was further strengthened by a quantitative 
survey of 1,390 decision-makers across key global 
markets, including 183 respondents from the banking 
sector. These leaders shared their experiences and 
perspectives on overcoming barriers to AI adoption, from 
dismantling legacy systems to addressing organizational 
inertia. In parallel, an 18-month research project evaluated 
the realistic value at stake for fully deploying and adopting 
generative AI. Together, these inputs offer a clear 
roadmap for organizations to unlock AI’s potential and 
drive meaningful, enterprise-wide change.

To understand how AI will usher in a new era of smart banking and create an intelligent bank, KPMG conducted an extensive research program, interviewing executive leaders across eight key global markets. This research outlines a comprehensive blueprint for AI in banking, helping banks chart a path toward unlocking AI’s immense value.

To address these challenges, KPMG introduces the three phases of AI value — a framework designed to guide banks through the AI adoption journey. This phased approach provides a structured roadmap, helping banks prioritize investments, align initiatives with business goals, and position themselves effectively in the age of AI in banking.
The Enable phase focuses on enabling people and building AI foundations. Organisations appoint a responsible executive, create an AI strategy, identify high-value use cases, boost AI literacy, align with regulations and establish ethical guardrails. AI pilots are launched across functions, while cloud platforms and pre-trained models are leveraged with minimal customisation.
The Embed phase integrates AI into workflows, products, services, value streams, robotics, and wearables, delivering greater value. A senior leader drives enterprise-wide workforce redesign, re-skilling and change, embedding AI into operating models with a focus on ethics, trust and security. AI agents and diverse models are deployed, supported by cloud and legacy tech modernisation, while enterprise-wide data enhances operations.
The Evolve phase evolves business models and ecosystems, using AI and frontier technologies like quantum computing and blockchain to solve large sector-wide challenges. AI orchestrates seamless value across enterprises and partners. Emphasizing ethics and trust with real-time security, this phase uplifts human potential with broad and deep workforce training, fostering a creative, innovative and value-driven future.

Intelligent banking: A blueprint for creating value through AI-driven transformation | 2
This report is the result of extensive research into 
the value being created by artificial intelligence (AI) 
within the banking sector. It is designed to provide 
actionable insights for leaders at every stage of 
their AI journey, from those deploying their first 
pilots to banks seeking to scale enterprise-wide 
AI initiatives. 
While some banks are highly advanced in their use of 
AI, many others face significant barriers that impede 
progress. Moving beyond tests and pilots is no longer an 
option — it is an imperative. This report serves as a guide 
to help banks navigate this critical transition and unlock 
AI’s transformative potential.
Banks are beginning to grapple with the reality that seizing 
the significant opportunities AI presents will require far 
more than just an investment in technology. It demands a 
holistic rethinking of strategy, culture, operation practices 
and an ethical framework for deployment.
Yet, many find themselves stalled by inertia. Long-term 
value is difficult to define, and many organizations 
struggle with setting clear objectives, identifying key 
performance indicators (KPIs) and proving return on 
investment (ROI). These challenges are compounded by 
the costs of technology upgrades, implementation risks 
and hesitations among senior executives who are eager 
to transform but cautious about leading the charge.
To prepare for an intelligent enterprise, banks should 
embrace AI as a driver of sustainable growth. By 
integrating AI across functions — from marketing 
and customer service to fraud prevention and risk 
management — banks can create innovative, customer-
centric solutions that not only enhance profitability but 
also deepen customer loyalty. This report provides the 
tools and insights needed to break through barriers, 
scale AI adoption and position banks to succeed in an 
increasingly competitive and intelligent future.
Foreword
AI is not just a technology investment 
for banks — it’s a catalyst for 
redefining strategy, operations and 
culture. To unlock its potential, banks 
must overcome inertia, embrace 
transformation and integrate AI as 
a core enabler of customer-centric, 
sustainable growth.

Introduction
Banks are increasingly experimenting with 
generative AI in isolated use cases, such as chatbots, 
content creation and personalized marketing. 
However, many are struggling to extract meaningful 
value from these efforts. Our study finds that while 
many financial institutions see AI as critical to their 
future, and beginning to realize efficiencies, only a 
small fraction report achieving revenue growth from 
their AI investments. 
Banks face unique challenges
Many struggle to establish a risk environment robust 
enough to support broader AI deployment, particularly in 
highly regulated areas like credit decisioning or compliance 
monitoring. Concerns about data governance, operational 
integrity and regulatory scrutiny create barriers to 
progress. At the same time, the rapid pace of technological 
advancements — combined with the competitive dynamics 
of proprietary versus open-source AI platforms — adds 
complexity, leaving banks uncertain about how to scale 
their efforts.
Banks embrace the new world of AI agents
AI agents are set to transform banking by enabling 
hyper-personalized, efficient and seamless customer 
experiences while driving operational efficiency.
These intelligent agents can act as 24/7 virtual advisors, 
providing tailored financial guidance, automating routine 
transactions and proactively managing customer 
needs based on real-time data and predictive insights. 
In operations, AI agents can streamline back-office 
processes, such as fraud detection, compliance 
monitoring, and risk assessment, by analyzing vast 
amounts of data with unmatched speed and precision. 
A blueprint for value
To overcome these challenges, seize the opportunity and 
prepare for the next generation of AI technologies, banks 
should adopt a deliberate, structured approach to AI 
adoption. In this report we introduce the three phases of 
AI value — a framework designed to help banks prioritize 
efforts, align investments and realize the full potential of AI.

Key considerations
Preparing for an AI future
Guiding your AI transformation
Introduction
Four key considerations that will likely accelerate AI adoption and the creation of long-term value:
Design an AI strategy that aligns 
with core competencies and 
unlocks value
Banks should establish a bold vision for 
AI that aligns with their core strengths. 
This vision should guide a transformation 
roadmap that redefines how AI drives 
growth and innovation while holding 
teams accountable for results. Aligning AI 
deployments with strategic goals — such 
as improving fraud detection, streamlining 
underwriting and enhancing customer 
personalization — can help maximize ROI.
Build trust into the 
transformation roadmap
AI in banking introduces unique risks that 
can undermine trust, meaning proactive 
risk management is critical from the 
outset. Banks should address data privacy 
and security challenges, helping ensure 
compliance with financial regulations 
while protecting sensitive customer 
information. Combating algorithmic bias 
and adopting explainable AI systems 
that regulators, customers, and internal 
stakeholders can trust is critical.
Create sustainable technology 
and data infrastructure for AI 
adoption
Data is a critical strategic asset and 
the foundation for all AI initiatives. 
Banks should build a robust data 
governance framework, focusing on 
quality, integration and security, while 
also creating a foundation for long-term 
scalability. This includes investing in 
enterprise-grade AI infrastructure that 
can support high volumes of transactions, 
complex risk models and real-time 
decision-making. ​ 
Build a culture that uses AI to 
uplift human potential
A multifaceted talent strategy that 
balances retention with upskilling is 
a key priority. Academic institutions, 
fintech startups and innovation hubs can 
inject fresh perspectives and enhance 
workforce capabilities. Immersive AI 
training programs help to drive innovation 
in customer experiences and operational 
models, diversify hiring pipelines and 
enable transformative outcomes.​

Current state
Banks are actively exploring and refining strategies to deploy AI. Amid 
foundational and talent readiness challenges, the banking sector is cautiously 
yet innovatively adopting AI, employing diverse implementation strategies and 
integrating complementary technologies to transform key business functions.
AI is no longer just a futuristic concept in banking — it’s already driving innovation in 
critical areas such as fraud detection, personalization and risk management. Leading 
global institutions are at the forefront, using AI to transform key processes and deliver 
enhanced customer experiences. These banks have identified hundreds of AI use cases, 
from streamlining operations to offering hyper-personalized products and services. 
However, for other banks the research highlights a number of inhibiting factors.
The foundational infrastructure is still in development
Banks face a challenge in building the critical infrastructure necessary to support scalable 
AI solutions. Only 25 percent have enterprise-wide cloud or hybrid-cloud platforms 
strategically supporting data-driven services, leaving many banks struggling to lay the 
groundwork for effective AI adoption.
Leaders and employees are just coming to grips with AI’s potential
Sixty-one percent of banks provide ethics and guardrails training for AI, helping 
employees navigate the responsible application of the technology. However, in-depth AI 
training remains limited, with only 30 percent offering advanced content that fosters a 
comprehensive understanding of AI capabilities.
Our organization is still in an experimental stage 
with respect to AI. We’ve not yet established any 
clear objectives or KPIs around how it’s used.

Making substantive progress is complicated by:
Significant concerns over AI risks and ethics
AI adoption in banking is accompanied by widespread 
concern about risks and ethical implications. 
Seventy-one percent of leaders agree that establishing 
robust frameworks for regulatory compliance is essential 
to ensure responsible AI implementation. 
Balancing AI adoption with sustainability 
objectives
However, balancing sustainability goals with AI initiatives 
poses a challenge, as 70 percent struggle to reconcile 
AI’s energy usage with their environmental objectives and 
66 percent view meeting sustainability goals as a higher 
strategic priority than implementing AI. 
Data is a significant barrier
The quality of data remains a major obstacle for banks 
seeking to scale AI adoption, with 72 percent expressing 
concerns about data quality. Without consistent, reliable 
and accessible data, banks face challenges in building 
accurate and effective AI models, stalling progress 
toward meaningful AI-driven transformation.
The biggest challenge right now is regulatory requirements and specific regulators 
for authorities from different locations from Spain, Germany, UK. They all have their 
different requirements and expectations.

Bankers are taking a wait-and-see approach
The rapid evolution of AI technologies is creating 
uncertainty and hesitation among banking leaders. 
Seventy-one percent believe it is best to wait for the 
AI tech landscape to stabilize before making significant 
investments, while 57 percent feel overwhelmed by the 
sheer volume of information and hype surrounding AI. 
AI expertise is limited
A lack of specialized AI expertise is also holding banks 
back, with only 19 percent guided by highly specialized 
AI teams driving strategy across the organization. In 
addition, just 18 percent use AI as a core driver for 
product and service development across multiple areas. 
Accuracy
Accuracy is a significant inhibitor to scaling AI in banking, 
as the highly regulated financial sector demands strict 
compliance with risk and regulatory requirements, 
leaving little room for error. Without mechanisms to 
ensure AI outputs are consistently accurate, repeatable 
and explainable, banks face the challenge of balancing 
innovation with the need for human oversight, which can 
slow down adoption and limit scalability.
Moving forward
It’s clear that bankers face a complex web of challenges 
as they navigate AI adoption. Despite significant efforts 
to implement AI, these fragmented strategies and limited 
readiness illustrate the need for a more structured approach.
In this report we introduce the three phases of AI value 
creation which is an organizational framework designed to 
help banks progress from isolated foundational capabilities 
to enterprise-wide innovation. By building trust, aligning 
strategies, enabling technology and empowering their 
workforce, banks can unlock AI’s transformative potential 
while mitigating risks. This framework not only offers an 
approach for successful adoption but also helps ensure 
that AI becomes a sustainable, strategic enabler for 
long-term growth and value.

Enable
The Enable phase focuses on enabling people and 
building AI foundations. Organizations appoint a 
responsible executive, create an AI strategy, identify 
high-value use cases, boost AI literacy, align with 
regulations and establish ethical guardrails. AI pilots 
are launched across functions, while cloud platforms 
and pre-trained models are leveraged with minimal 
customization.
Embed
The Embed phase integrates AI into workflows, 
products, services, value streams, robotics and 
wearables, delivering greater value. A senior leader 
drives enterprise-wide workforce redesign, re-skilling 
and change, embedding AI into operating models with 
a focus on ethics, trust and security. AI agents and 
diverse models are deployed, supported by cloud and 
legacy tech modernization, while enterprise-wide data 
enhances operations.
Evolve
The Evolve phase evolves business models and 
ecosystems, using AI and frontier technologies like 
quantum computing and blockchain to solve large 
sector-wide challenges. AI can orchestrate seamless 
value across enterprises and partners. Emphasizing 
ethics and trust with real-time security, this phase 
uplifts human potential with broad and deep 
workforce training, fostering a creative, innovative 
and value-driven future.
A company may have a portfolio of initiatives aimed at any level (of the operating model) within each phase. The ratio of effort and investment across the phases will vary as the 
organization matures. Initially, most resources will focus on phase one, with a small effort to explore enterprise-wide transformation. Over time, as foundational efficiencies are 
realized more effort is invested in phase two, while, with an eye on the future, long-term investments in phase three start to lay the groundwork for transformative innovation. This 
dynamic balancing act ensures banks can achieve immediate results while setting themselves up in the right way for future success.
The journey to become an intelligent bank
Effective AI-enabled transformation goes beyond technology implementation. By examining leading practice, we have 
identified that banks can increase capability and value across three phases of AI transformation. 
This provides a structured yet flexible framework for navigating the complexities of AI adoption. It balances the need 
for short-term efficiency gains with the imperative to prepare for future growth and innovation. It helps banks prioritize 
their efforts, allocate resources effectively, build capability and align their AI initiatives with both short-term goals and 
long-term strategic objectives.

Phases of the 
AI journey
Focusing on maturity across the three phases — 
Enable, Embed and Evolve — is critical for 
sustained value creation. It requires increasing 
the maturity of the capabilities that are vital to 
the foundations, functions and enterprise layers 
simultaneously. 
At the enterprise layer, increased AI maturity involves 
orchestrating AI across functions to enable enterprise-
wide innovation and strategic alignment. Without a 
balanced focus on all three layers, organizations risk 
missing opportunities for transformation.
At the functions layer, AI should be embedded into 
key value streams, optimizing specific processes and 
creating improved outcomes, such as more compelling 
products and services and more engaging, end-to-end 
employee and customer experiences.
At the foundations layer, organizations should build up 
the new AI-first technology stack, through a process 
of technology modernization. Infrastructure, data, 
models and applications can all become optimized for 
delivery of AI.

Consequently, most banks focus on reducing costs and 
increasing efficiency. AI automates repetitive, manual 
processes, which can help streamline operations and 
minimize human error. For example:
Fraud detection and prevention: Several banks 
are using AI to analyze transactional data in real time, 
identifying patterns indicative of fraud. This automation 
not only reduces the workload for fraud analysts but 
also enhances accuracy and speed, minimizing financial 
losses. For instance, in 2023, a major credit card 
company thwarted 80 million fraudulent transactions 
worth $40 billion globally, attributing this success to 
substantial investments in AI technology.1
Document processing: A major US bank uses AI to 
review and analyze thousands of legal documents in 
seconds. This task previously required hundreds of 
hours of manual labor, significantly reducing costs and 
human error.
Loan underwriting: AI-driven automation is resulting in 
faster and more accurate loan underwriting decisions. At 
one global bank, AI-based underwriting has reduced loan 
processing cycle times from 30 to 16 days, effectively 
doubling underwriting efficiency. By analyzing vast 
amounts of customer data, including credit history, 
income patterns and risk indicators, AI models identify 
and assess creditworthiness with speed and precision, 
enabling faster decision-making while minimizing errors.2

AI is changing the customer 
experience in banking
AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are 
revolutionizing customer service by providing instant 
responses to common queries, transaction searches and 
account management tasks. First-generation chatbots 
are being upgraded to conversational, contextually aware 
chatbots that emulate human interactions. These tools 
reduce wait times and allow customers to access support 
24/7, offering convenience and reliability. Similarly, 
AI-driven personalization engines analyze transaction 
history, spending patterns and demographics to deliver 
tailored product recommendations, such as suggesting 
relevant credit card offers or savings plans. 
As mentioned, AI also improves customer experience by 
enhancing transaction security and reducing fraud. HSBC, 
for example, uses AI to detect fraud across millions of 
accounts, providing customers with a sense of security 
and trust. These innovations make everyday banking 
more seamless, secure and customer-centric, laying 
the groundwork for deeper engagement and loyalty in 
later stages.
Banks are leveraging AI to revolutionize know your 
customer (KYC) processes, improving efficiency, accuracy 
and compliance. AI-powered tools automate identity 
verification, analyze vast datasets to detect anomalies 
When we started leveraging AI, 
especially for some of our solutions, 
usually for the customer enrolment 
process, we acquired many customers 
through the chatbot system, which 
resulted in more revenue.

and flag potential risks in real time, significantly reducing 
the time and cost associated with traditional KYC checks. 
Machine learning algorithms enhance fraud detection 
by identifying patterns of suspicious activity that may 
go unnoticed by manual processes. Additionally, natural 
language processing (NLP) enables banks to extract and 
verify critical information from unstructured documents, 
such as passports and utility bills, with precision. By 
integrating AI into KYC, banks can strengthen regulatory 
compliance and also enhance the customer experience 
through faster, frictionless onboarding.

AI and the employee experience
For employees, AI in the first phase automates repetitive processes such as data 
entry, document verification and compliance checks, reducing errors and freeing 
up employees to focus on customers. This not only increases efficiency but also 
reduces the mental fatigue associated with repetitive, manual work. 
AI tools also act as cognitive assistants, supporting employees with real-time 
insights and help with decision-making. Relationship managers and call center 
agents are using AI-driven dashboards that provide personalized customer 
information, such as financial goals or recent inquiries, allowing for more meaningful 
and informed interactions. Additionally, predictive analytics help employees 
anticipate customer needs, enabling proactive outreach and tailored solutions.
By minimizing administrative burdens and empowering employees, AI can help 
banks deliver better customer experiences.
AI will change the way we hire people, from the number of staff 
that are required to do certain functions, the types of staff and 
the number of people in certain roles. I don’t think there’ll be 
less staff, but I just think they’ll be doing different things.

A major German bank
Case study
The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) at a major German bank shared insights into its journey toward AI adoption. The bank applies AI in key areas like anti-money laundering, fraud 
detection and compliance monitoring, aiming to streamline processes such as transaction monitoring and KYC.
Current AI usage 
Experimentation without a cohesive AI strategy 
The bank’s current AI usage is fragmented. Although individual teams are 
independently experimenting with AI tools such as Copilot in Power BI 
and Gen AI, the bank does not have a cohesive organizational AI strategy. 
Despite this decentralized implementation, AI has proven instrumental 
in enhancing efficiency, particularly by programmers who are using it to 
streamline coding, or for data processing by the data analytics teams. 
This has saved the teams significant time on repetitive tasks. 
Initially hesitant to adopt AI, the bank has since transitioned into 
a cautious integration phase, acknowledging the technology’s 
transformative potential while remaining mindful of associated risks.
Challenges 
Navigating regulatory, technical 
and human hurdles in AI adoption 
The bank faces several challenges in its 
AI adoption, including meeting stringent 
regulatory requirements for explaining how 
AI decisions are made, which are critical for 
compliance. 
In addition, the CCO notes that legacy 
systems and data silos create technical 
barriers that hinder seamless integration, 
while a lack of staff expertise hinders 
the effective evaluation and utilization of 
AI outputs.
Outlook 
Leaders expect to be more 
agile and open-minded as 
they embrace AI’s potential
The bank’s journey mirrors industry 
trends and the struggle of balancing 
AI’s potential with regulatory and 
workplace challenges. Although the 
respondent mentions that a unified 
AI strategy is expected by mid-2025, 
they highlight the need for 
leaders to become more agile and 
experimental to drive AI innovation 
and guide AI usage responsibly.

Making a step change in regulatory compliance with Gen AI
Case study
Client challenge
KPMG’s client, a leading global banking group 
serving over 21 million customers offers a 
wide range of banking, insurance and asset 
management services to individuals, businesses 
and institutional clients.
The risk team, however, has struggled to 
find an efficient way to navigate and comply 
with 17 separate regulations that involve over 
2,000 regulatory requirements across over 
1,600 pages. 
The team faced difficulties in comparing the most 
recent version of the regulations with previous 
versions of regulations and drawing synthetic 
opinions efficiently. The manual process required 
a significant amount of time and effort and has led 
to concerns related to potential compliance risks.
Our approach
Professionals from a KPMG member firm analyzed 
the available AI solutions on the market and built a 
customized Gen AI chatbot. 
This technology solution operates on a “chat-with-
document” logic, which means that changes to 
policy documents can be visualized, reducing the 
time it takes for employees to review and compare 
documents and extract specific information.
It integrates relevant banking regulations and 
produced responses through pre-defined prompts 
and precise questioning.
A proof of concept (POC) was developed initially to 
demonstrate the model’s capability to learn from 
a closed set of regulatory documents that were 
overseen by human experts to mitigate risks.
Value delivered
The Gen AI chatbot solution demonstrated the 
potential to shift from a primarily manual review 
process to an AI-assisted approach that reduces 
time, effort and risk.
Thirty-six regulatory compliance evaluation cases 
within the POC were tested and validated the 
model’s high confidence level in generating the 
expected results.
It represents the first step in an evolutionary 
path for the technology, including extending 
it to all relevant regulations, comparative 
analyses and integration into the bank’s cost 
optimization system.

Second phase
The focus is on breaking down silos, redesigning the ways banks unlock more complex 
value opportunities in the second phase. AI becomes embedded across the bank’s 
core functions, enabling dynamic decision-making, real-time insights and predictive 
personalization.
Shared data platforms foster collaboration and a culture of agility and innovation. 
Customer satisfaction scores, cross-sell effectiveness, and speed-to-market join 
efficiency and cost reduction as key metrics of success.
Banks also need to prepare for agentic AI, which is rapidly evolving in capability. Initially, 
macros (simple, rule-based agents) operate on data tasks like credit scoring and fraud 
detection. As banks advance, software (platform-based) agents will be configured to 
handle more complex, context-aware tasks, acting as semi-autonomous assistants. 
Banks should build shared data platforms for use by deterministic AI or true agents 
built on ‘large action models’ that can independently assess risks, design products and 
optimize entire value streams like loan processing.
This can drive a paradigm shift in how a bank’s workforce is shaped, where employees 
go from traditional roles to becoming managers of AI agents, treating these systems as 
complex cognitive co-workers. In this model, employees are no longer merely task executors 
but orchestrators of AI-driven workflows, overseeing and optimizing the performance of 
advanced AI agents capable of handling complex, context-aware operations.
We use AI to help us accelerate development, speed up time to 
market, production cycles and project life cycles… I think it will help 
us to drive revenue.

Loan origination: This value stream encompasses the entire process 
of a customer applying for a loan: inquiry, risk assessment, approval, 
disbursement, servicing and eventually, closure.
Onboarding and account opening: This journey begins when a 
customer first engages with the bank, opening an account, going 
through compliance checks and receiving initial financial services. 
Fraud prevention: This stream spans the entire banking system, 
integrating real-time fraud detection, risk mitigation and customer 
protection activities into one seamless process. 
Payment processing: Covering a wide range of activities, this 
stream involves domestic and cross-border transactions, payment 
approvals, reconciliation and real-time tracking of funds. 
Customer retention and growth: This focuses on the continuous 
engagement with a customer over their financial lifecycle, including 
personalized advice, loyalty programs and customer satisfaction 
management.

Barriers to realizing value
Banks should address critical foundational activities early on, as failing to do so can 
stall progress. Key barriers include an incomplete vision for the future operating 
model, outdated foundational and technology infrastructure, and inadequate 
governance frameworks to mitigate risks and uphold ethical standards. 
Equally vital is securing the buy-in of leaders and employees by demonstrating AI’s 
transformative potential. Specific areas for focus include:
Lack of trust 
As AI becomes integral to processes, banks face increasing pressure to maintain 
transparency and trust, both internally and externally. Scaling AI without robust 
frameworks for accountability and explainability can lead to mistrust among 
employees, customers and regulators.
Managing strategy implementation
Scaling and embedding AI across the organization requires a profound transformation 
of structures and leadership. Most banks are historically organized around products 
such as credit cards, mortgages or savings accounts, with each function operating 
in silos. Moving to value streams disrupts these legacy structures, requiring 
processes that cut across departments and focus on end-to-end customer journeys. 
Change management becomes a critical task, as banks must not only roll out new 
technologies but also foster acceptance of new workflows and cultural norms. Poorly 
managed transitions risk low adoption of AI tools, employee dissatisfaction and 
stalled transformation efforts.

Workforce concerns
Many banks lack the in-house expertise to meet 
AI’s demands. This talent gap slows the pace of 
transformation, as banks struggle to upskill employees 
or hire specialized professionals, but upskilling and talent 
acquisition are only part of the battle, this shift often 
encounters resistance from teams and leaders aligned to 
specific products, slowing the adoption of value stream 
approaches. For instance, aligning risk, operations and 
customer service into a single value stream like “home 
ownership” can create tensions as functions adjust to 
new ways of working.
The transformation also has significant implications for 
employees and organizational structures. Many roles will 
evolve as automation reduces the need for routine tasks, 
requiring employees to shift to higher-value activities, such 
as oversight and strategic decision-making. This creates 
uncertainty among staff, who may fear losing relevance: A 
2024 KPMG global customer experience excellence study 
found that younger employees in particular are worried 
that entry level jobs will no longer exist because of AI.3 
Early wins are needed to generate momentum.
Leadership also plays a pivotal role in this transition. 
Scaling AI demands leaders who can break down silos, 
I think the biggest challenge is people’s 
adoption and having a common 
understanding of the tech. I think that’s 
the biggest one, readiness. Then, the 
change management piece is always 
a journey.

align cross-functional teams, and foster a culture of 
experimentation and collaboration. However, traditional 
leadership styles in banking, often hierarchical and 
risk-averse, are not always equipped for these demands. 
Leaders must champion value streams and empower 
teams to innovate, even when this disrupts established 
practices. Without such transformational leadership, 
efforts to scale AI may falter.
The technology evolution
Significant investment is required to roll out new 
technologies that can support AI at scale. Banks must 
implement advanced machine learning platforms, real-
time analytics and scalable infrastructure like cloud 
computing. These investments may conflict with 
existing IT roadmaps and budgets, creating delays 
and prioritization challenges. Legacy issues also play a 
big role. Banks are increasingly turning to AI-enabled 
software re-engineering tools (such as Codeium) to 
tackle the challenges of legacy code and technical debt. 
These tools analyze, refactor and optimize outdated 
codebases, making them more efficient, secure and 
maintainable. They automate labor-intensive tasks like 
identifying redundant code, optimizing performance 
bottlenecks and modernizing code to align with current 
programming standards.

An American financial services company
Specializing in cash handling and manufacturing smart 
safes and point-of-sale equipment, Loomis, a US financial 
services company, employs 23,000 people across 
20 countries and generates US$3 billion annually. Chief 
Information Officer (CIO) Kendall Knight discussed how 
the organization uses AI to improve operations and create 
new business opportunities.
Current AI usage: Using AI for operational excellence 
and customer engagement
The organization employs Gen AI and machine learning to 
solve operational and customer engagement challenges. 
Gen AI enhances response capabilities, personalizes 
customer interactions and provides 24/7 service. 
Machine learning applications include a software-as-a-
service (SaaS) offering that forecasts cash requirement 
for banks and credit unions, generating US$20 million 
annually. Internally, AI analyzes video and data patterns 
to detect internal theft, replacing manual processes and 
significantly improving efficiency. 
Challenges: Overcoming expertise, compliance and 
innovation challenges in AI adoption
Identifying meaningful use cases, ensuring compliance 
with strict banking regulations, data governance and 
privacy, and overcoming legacy system constraints are 
challenges. Loomis initially lacked in-house expertise, 
so it relied on external consultants and freelance data 
scientists to implement pilot programs. Business leaders 
are still developing their understanding of AI’s capabilities 
and limitations.
Organization’s AI outlook: Scaling AI across 
departments to drive competitive advantage
Looking ahead, Knight envisions broader AI adoption 
across departments, enabling efficiencies in areas 
like finance, human resources and operations. The 
company expects significant changes in leadership roles, 
emphasizing the need for cross-functional AI knowledge.

The Evolve phase transforms enterprises to adapt to market 
disruptions, forming new business models and ecosystems 
to solve larger, industry-wide problems. Companies establish 
and orchestrate ecosystems with customers, suppliers and 
governments, orchestrated by AI to deliver seamless value. 
The third phase gives the biggest payoff. As AI enables costs to 
come down, some markets will grow, some decline, and new 
ones emerge. Invest in areas of price elasticity — things we can 
do more of with AI as costs decline. Your competitors may focus 
more on what is disappearing and risk being replaced.

Third phase
AI-driven autonomous 
banking
AI takes full control of managing customer 
finances. AI-driven systems automatically 
manage account balances, optimize 
investment portfolios, and even adjust 
loan terms in real time based on market 
conditions and customer financial 
behavior. For example, a retail bank in the 
UK is experimenting with fully 
autonomous banking services that 
automatically transfer money between 
accounts based on real-time cash flow 
analysis.
AI-powered digital 
marketplaces
Leading banks are increasingly 
transforming into platform businesses, 
using AI to create digital ecosystems 
where customers can access a range of 
services from third-party providers. AI 
helps banks match customers with the 
most relevant products and services, 
whether it’s a mortgage from a partner 
bank or an insurance product from a 
fintech company. Ping An in China has 
already developed a comprehensive 
financial ecosystem, using AI to integrate 
insurance, banking and health services 
into a seamless customer experience.4 
Ping An reported over 202 billion Chinese 
Yuan Renminbi (RMB) in AI-driven product 
sales as a result of this approach.5
Blockchain and AI 
synergy
In the third phase, banks are exploring the 
intersection of AI and blockchain to 
enhance security, transparency and 
operational efficiency. By combining AI’s 
predictive power with the decentralized 
nature of blockchain, banks can offer more 
secure and efficient services, such as 
smart contracts that automatically execute 
agreements based on predefined 
conditions. J.P. Morgan’s Quorum 
blockchain platform integrates AI to create 
secure, transparent transactions in its 
trading and financial services.6
AI-driven predictive 
finance
In this phase, banks use AI to move 
from reactive to predictive finance, 
where AI not only helps customers 
manage their money but anticipates 
their needs and financial goals. Banks 
can offer predictive insights, such as 
when a customer might need a loan, 
helping them plan their financial future 
with precision.

decision-making tools. 
Head of AI — Canada
Leading banks are already exhibiting third phase 
characteristics, creating and orchestrating new 
ecosystems. 
Banks can enhance their core offerings by integrating 
with partners in wealth management, health solutions 
and sustainability. Fintechs, tech giants and non-financial 
partners can help banks create a holistic ecosystem 
tailored to customer needs. For example, customers 
may access real-time financial insights alongside tailored 
investment recommendations, lifestyle perks or business 
analytics — all from a unified, AI-driven platform.
Ping An and BBVA have developed open banking 
platforms that allow third-party developers to create 
applications that integrate with its services.
Banking will likely also become deeply predictive and 
proactive. Instead of customers seeking financial 
services, the bank anticipates their needs and delivers 
services seamlessly at the right time, through the 
right channel. For example, AI-powered assistants 
may analyze spending patterns to suggest cost-saving 
measures or automatically optimize loan terms based on 
market conditions.
Financial services integrate invisibly into customers’ daily 
lives, embedded within other activities like shopping, 
traveling or running a business. AI can enable this by 
providing instant, contextual financial decisions in real 
time, without requiring active customer input.

European bank boosts customer insight analysis for product 
development with AI
Case study
Client challenge
KPMG’s client is a European bank specializing in 
serving small and medium enterprises. It has several 
brands, subsidiaries and associated banks. 
The client sought to gain a better understanding of 
customers’ perceptions and experiences to improve 
their products and services. 
Their primary challenge was the complexity of 
extracting actionable insights from the large volume 
of qualitative data collected through customer 
satisfaction surveys.
The objective was to gain detailed insight into 
customer sentiment toward the bank’s offerings, 
pinpointing satisfaction levels, areas of discontent and 
the general sentiment toward the bank.
Our approach
The KPMG team leveraged its OpenAI platform 
to conduct a detailed sentiment analysis of the 
customer satisfaction survey responses to extract 
actionable insights. 
With the help of Python, MS Excel and OpenAI, the 
KPMG team created and analyzed a large dataset 
of responses to generate an overview of customer 
sentiment. 
A close examination of the emotional content of the 
feedback allowed the range of customer emotions — 
from satisfied to disappointed — to be charted in 
detail. The bank recognized this as a strategic method 
for developing a deeper understanding of customer 
perception to allow targeted improvements that 
enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Value delivered
The analysis provided a refined understanding of 
overall customer sentiment, allowing the bank to 
identify areas of strength and opportunities for 
improvement. 
The AI implementation helped reduce response 
time for customer feedback from months to weeks 
through automated AI-driven analysis. It also provided 
a deeper level of analysis that had not previously 
been available. 
The use of Gen AI reduced the survey data analysis 
time by 75 percent, and reduced manual errors by 
5 percent. 
At a strategic level, the approach contributed to 
improved product and service offerings. As these 
improvements were based on customer feedback, 
they led to higher customer satisfaction levels 
and loyalty.

Four strategic actions
The research reveals that those organizations that are realizing the most value 
from their AI investments have focused on four strategic actions:
Leaders should craft a vision that aligns core competencies — product 
innovation, customer success, data management and ecosystem 
partnerships — with AI capabilities, while ensuring accountability for execution 
and outcomes. Leadership accountability is critical to help ensure that the 
vision translates into measurable impact. Leaders help actively engage with 
ecosystem players, fostering collaboration to strengthen AI strategies. By 
uniting teams across engineering, product and data science, and focusing 
on market leadership and customer experience innovation, leaders can drive 
alignment and ensure measurable impact from AI initiatives.
Design an AI strategy that aligns with core 
competencies and unlocks value

Source: [Title], KPMG International, 2025
•	
Define a unified AI vision and strategy
Leaders should articulate a clear, organization-wide vision for AI 
that aligns with the bank’s core competencies — such as product 
innovation, customer success and ecosystem partnerships. This vision 
should be specific, actionable, and tied to measurable outcomes, 
helping them to ensure that all teams understand how AI initiatives 
contribute to broader business goals. 
•	
Establish cross-functional collaboration
Before attempting to break down silos between engineering, product 
and data science teams, banks should baseline their infrastructure 
and operating model maturity to assess readiness for larger 
operating model transformation. Banks should create cross-functional 
teams focused on understanding where the bank can productize 
services, using AI to create new business model opportunities and 
fuel growth.
•	
Implement measurable objectives and key results (OKRs)
Banks should adopt robust performance measurement frameworks, 
such as OKRs, to track the effectiveness of the implementation of 
the strategy across the organization. These metrics should be tied 
to strategic business outcomes, such as revenue growth, customer 
satisfaction or market share. Regularly evaluating progress against 
these metrics helps ensure that AI initiatives remain aligned with the 
organization’s strategic priorities and provides a basis for iterative 
improvement.

I think they’re going to have to understand 
far better what kind of risks lie therein. 
Divisional Director — Australia
As banks advance across the three phases of AI adoption, 
the potential for risk and reputational damage grows 
exponentially. Governance, ethics and accurate data are 
critical to maintaining stakeholder trust and unlocking AI’s 
transformative potential.
Build trust into the 
transformation roadmap
•	
Establish robust AI governance
frameworks
Banks should implement comprehensive AI
governance structures that set clear standards for
accountability, transparency and compliance. This
includes defining roles and responsibilities across
teams, establishing protocols for monitoring AI
performance and creating mechanisms to address
risks such as algorithmic accountability and ethical
considerations proactively. Leaders and employees
need to trust the AI tools they are using if they are
to advocate their use to others.
•	
Embed ethical and bias-detection
mechanisms
Ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in AI systems
is essential. Banks should develop and deploy tools
that continuously audit AI models for unintended
biases, especially in sensitive applications like credit
decisioning or fraud detection. This requires diverse
and representative training datasets, regular model
testing and clear guidelines for acceptable model
outcomes. Collaborating with independent auditors
or ethics boards can provide additional oversight
and credibility.
•	
Prioritize privacy by design
As banks handle vast amounts of customer data,
integrating privacy considerations into every stage
of AI development is crucial. Adopting a ‘privacy by
design’ approach means implementing encryption,
anonymization and secure data-sharing practices as
standard. This helps ensure compliance with data
protection laws and builds trust with customers
and stakeholders.
•	
Invest in security and resilience
AI systems are increasingly attractive targets
for cyberattacks, including model poisoning
and adversarial attacks. Banks should focus on
eliminating the weakest links in the infrastructure
and invest in advanced security measures to
protect AI systems and underlying data. This
includes implementing real-time monitoring for
anomalies, regularly updating defenses and training
teams to respond to emerging threats. Building
resilience into AI systems helps ensure that they
can continue to function reliably even in the face of
disruptions or breaches.

Create sustainable technology and 
data infrastructure for AI adoption
3
Banks should balance the need for experimentation 
with the pursuit of scalable returns. As the AI landscape 
evolves, banks should make ‘no-regret’ investments 
looking for early wins that build momentum and can 
provide a solid foundation for future innovation — 
regardless of how the technology matures. 
•	
Invest in scalable and flexible infrastructure
Banks should build a robust, cloud-native 
infrastructure capable of supporting the dynamic 
needs of AI technologies. This includes adopting 
platforms that enable machine learning operations 
for efficient model deployment and lifecycle 
management. By focusing on scalable solutions, 
banks can help ensure they have the flexibility to 
expand AI initiatives as needs grow, avoiding the 
pitfalls of rigid, short-term fixes.
•	
Establish comprehensive data 
management practices
High-quality, unified data is the backbone of effective 
AI. Banks should prioritize investments in advanced 
data platforms that consolidate siloed datasets into a 
single source of truth, enabling seamless data access 
and governance. Implementing tools for data quality, 
lineage and security ensures AI models are built 
on reliable foundations and can adapt as regulatory 
requirements or business needs evolve. Banks should 
clean, organize and validate data to keep it free from 
inconsistencies, redundancies and biases that could 
undermine AI performance. Observability tools can 
monitor data health continuously, addressing potential 
issues before they impact AI outcomes.
•	
Focus on modular and interoperable 
solutions
To help future-proof their technology stack, 
banks should invest in modular AI systems 
that can integrate with existing tools and 
accommodate emerging technologies. 
Open APIs, interoperable software and 
vendor-agnostic solutions allow banks to 
experiment with new innovations without 
locking themselves into specific ecosystems. 
This approach helps ensure flexibility in 
responding to technological advancements.
•	
Create a balanced investment 
portfolio
Banks should adopt a dual strategy of 
no-regret foundational investments — such 
as infrastructure, data management and 
governance frameworks — paired with 
controlled experimentation in cutting-edge AI 
technologies like generative AI or autonomous 
systems. This balance helps ensure the 
organization can drive immediate value 
while remaining agile enough to adopt 
transformative innovations as they mature.

Build a culture that uses AI to 
uplift human potential 
4
Human expertise remains indispensable alongside AI-driven 
automation. Attracting top talent in AI and machine learning 
is one of the most pressing challenges for the banking 
sector, given the increasing global demand for these 
specialists. To meet this challenge, companies should not 
only recruit the best but also focus on upskilling and reskilling 
their existing workforce. Investing in robust learning and 
development programs helps ensure employees stay ahead 
of the curve as technology evolves. Such efforts are critical 
to building internal expertise and fostering a workforce 
capable of adapting to new AI capabilities and opportunities.
•	
Foster transformational leadership
Leadership should evolve to champion AI adoption 
by fostering a culture of trust, transparency and 
collaboration. Leaders should actively communicate 
the strategic vision for AI, emphasizing its role as 
an enabler rather than a disruptor. Transformational 
leadership practices, such as empowering teams 
to experiment with AI, recognizing successes and 
addressing concerns openly, help build confidence 
and alignment across the organization. Leaders 
also need to model adaptability, demonstrating 
a willingness to embrace change and invest in 
their own AI knowledge to guide the organization 
effectively.
•	
Build an AI-literate workforce
Banks should create tailored learning programs that 
provide employees with a foundational understanding 
of AI, its applications and its implications for their 
roles. Upskilling should go beyond technical teams; 
employees across all functions, including operations, 
customer service and risk management, need 
to understand how AI impacts their work and 
enhances their decision-making capabilities. For 
technical roles, banks should provide specialized 
training in AI development, machine learning and 
data science to close the talent gap.
•	
Address cultural resistance through change 
management
Overcoming cultural resistance requires a structured 
change management approach that includes clear 
communication, employee engagement and support 
systems. Banks should proactively address fears around 
job displacement by emphasizing how AI can augment 
roles rather than replace them. Engaging employees in 
co-creating AI solutions fosters buy-in and helps ensure 
AI tools are designed with their practical needs in mind. 
Establishing forums for feedback, collaboration and 
success stories can help dispel misconceptions and 
create enthusiasm for AI-driven transformation.
•	
Redefine roles and career pathways
AI will likely fundamentally change the nature of work 
in banking, requiring a redefinition of roles and career 
pathways. Banks should identify areas where AI can 
automate routine tasks and shift employees toward 
higher-value activities, such as customer engagement, 
strategic analysis and innovation. Clearly mapping out 
these new career opportunities and pathways helps 
employees see AI as a means of growth rather than a 
threat. Additionally, banks should establish new roles, 
such as AI ethics officers or value-stream leaders, 
to align human expertise with AI capabilities to help 
ensure responsible implementation.

AI future
It has become a cliché to warn that banks must move 
quickly on AI or risk being left behind, but clichés often 
contain a grain of truth. Our research highlights a deeper 
tension: banks, inherently risk-averse institutions, currently 
perceive the risks of AI as outweighing its benefits. 
This hesitancy creates a significant barrier to progress. 
Banking executives face a dual imperative: they must 
simultaneously articulate the transformative potential of 
AI and address its associated risks in a way that inspires 
confidence across the organization.
Figure 8: A variety of benefits are selected in the top 5, showing that 
organizations are yet to distinguish where AI can be best used
Percentage who say their organization has achieved the following beneﬁts through using AI
Increased operational efﬁciency and cost reduction
Improved stakeholder management
Fewer business risks and greater regulatory compliance
Improved data analytics and insights
Gaining competitive advantage in the market
Enhanced customer experience
Enhanced supply chain management
Increased revenue/growth
Optimized ﬁnancial planning and forecasting
Better supported sustainability and environmental goals
Faster, data-driven decision-making
Strengthened cybersecurity and data privacy

Preparing for an AI future
AI is not a passing 
trend; it is an 
accelerating force 
that continues to 
evolve and disrupt.
The first step is to build a compelling case for AI’s 
long-term benefits, showing how it can fundamentally 
transform the business. This requires thinking beyond 
incremental efficiencies and envisioning a future where 
AI drives personalized customer experiences, optimizes 
risk management and enables entirely new business 
models. Leaders should engage in rigorous strategic 
analysis, including wargaming scenarios that explore how 
AI might reshape the competitive landscape. What will 
competitors do? How might non-banking entrants and 
tech companies encroach on traditional markets? What 
are the risks of inaction, such as losing customers to 
more agile rivals or being disintermediated by fintechs? 
Answering these questions should galvanize action, 
making the cost of doing nothing starkly clear.
At the same time, banks should confront the risks of 
AI head-on. Moving forward with AI as an enterprise-
wide asset requires robust frameworks for identifying, 
mitigating and monitoring risks. These include ethical 
concerns like bias, compliance challenges, security 
vulnerabilities and the operational risks inherent in relying 
on complex models. Leaders need to create a culture 
of transparency and build processes that surface risks 
early, with mechanisms to detect and address unknown 
risks as they emerge. Proactive risk management isn’t 
about eliminating uncertainty — it’s about managing it 
effectively enough to move forward with confidence.
AI is not a passing trend; it is an accelerating force that 
continues to evolve and disrupt. To navigate this reality, 
banks should take no-regrets actions — foundational 
investments in scalable infrastructure, data governance 
and AI-friendly operating models — that position them 
to capitalize on future breakthroughs. These actions can 
help ensure that when the technology advances, the bank 
is ready to integrate, adapt and thrive. Inaction is not an 
option; banks should balance the perceived risks with the 
transformative potential of AI to remain competitive and 
relevant in a rapidly changing financial landscape.

To gain a broad understanding of how leaders are 
navigating the opportunities and challenges of 
implementing AI, KPMG International conducted a robust 
research program involving multiple methodologies. 
This included in-depth interviews with eight AI experts 
spanning technology, government regulation and 
industry, as well as discussions with sector-specific 
KPMG specialists. Qualitative research was conducted 
to uncover nuanced, industry-specific challenges and 
opportunities, including insights from several industry 
experts, such as Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University, 
a renowned authority on AI and digital transformation.
The research was further strengthened by a quantitative 
survey of 1,390 decision-makers across key global 
markets, including 183 respondents from the banking 
sector. These leaders shared their experiences and 
perspectives on overcoming barriers to AI adoption, from 
dismantling legacy systems to addressing organizational 
inertia. In parallel, an 18-month research project evaluated 
the realistic value at stake for fully deploying and adopting 
generative AI. Together, these inputs offer a clear 
roadmap for organizations to unlock AI’s potential and 
drive meaningful, enterprise-wide change.

Discover the latest insights into consumer retail trends and the dynamic landscape of retail M&A as we dive into a broad market analysis for 2025. With the retail industry facing significant challenges, our analysis reveals that major shifts in valuations, due diligence, and post-merger integration are on the horizon.
Having navigated the complexities of post-covid supply chain shocks and input inflation which required significant pricing action, Consumer and Retail (C&R) CEOs are back to focusing on delivering much-needed volume growth.
Yet, for many sub-sectors, volume growth will come second to volume preservation. Facing pressure on consumer spend from declines in disposable incomes, shifts towards unbranded products and waning product loyalty, many consumer goods companies are struggling to arrest declining volumes.
Looking ahead, we expect 2025 to be characterised by a more ruthless review of dilutive and non-core businesses as organisations focus on their core. However, activity will vary by region and by sector. Alongside strategic divestments, expect to see significant bolt-on activity as organisations look for lower-risk, above-average growth opportunities.
This report provides valuable insights to help dealmakers act with confidence in what we expect to be a more active year for M&A ahead.

C&R companies will look at evaluating their portfolios and divesting non-core assets, product lines and subsidiaries that do not align with their long-term strategic objectives.
2024 saw leadership changes at many large players in the C&R space and our analysis suggests these new leaders are particularly keen on bolt-on acquisitions.
Anticipating continued economic uncertainty and where risk appetite is limited, expect to see an uptick in bolt-on acquisitions.
Expect more activist investor attention on the C&R sector in 2025 as activists look at other players with unaddressed value creation opportunities.
With new direct investors such as Sovereign Wealth Funds moving more aggressively into deal markets, expect greater competition for deals.
For many sub-sectors, volume growth will come second to preservation. See the M&A deal activity trends from 2018–2024 in the sectors analysis.
Anticipate a flurry of new deals to come to market as C&R players refocus on the core and divest of non-core categories and geographies. Some of this activity will be to achieve cost optimisation and shore up margins. But many will also be trying to adjust their footprints to reflect new international trade dynamics, unlock market access and reduce their geopolitical risk.
Despite lower deal volumes in 2024, 2025 should bring a further wave of strategic acquisitions as companies and investors look to enhance their digital and omnichannel capabilities (primarily focused on integrating AI and improving e-commerce offerings) and drive seamless integration between online and physical store experiences, especially in the non-food retail sector.
Compared to other C&R sectors, dealmaking in the home and personal care segment may remain slow in the first half of 2025 as investors and PE managers focus on higher growth sub sectors. But expect 2025 to be a turnaround year, characterised by measurable growth in both deal volumes and values.
Despite many consumers having lower disposable income, spending on pets increased among high-income households. The trend towards the humanisation of animals leads to a greater desire to provide them with high-quality, nutritious foods. Expect to see growth in demand and in deal activity for assets offering fresh, frozen and freeze-dried premium products to high-end customer segments.
Ultimately, the deal outlook for the luxury goods segment is largely dependent on the macroeconomic environment. Few sectors are as exposed to economic disruption as luxury goods. The prospect of trade wars (which often hit luxury goods first), increased geopolitical tension and slow economic growth in 2025 will likely keep investors cautious.
How will these trends impact your organisation?Download the full reportopens in a new tabtoday to learn more.
Given the rapid pace of change, both within the sector and across the global economy, understanding the trends will be key to unlocking value, driving growth and enabling transformation for dealmakers. We hope this report provides valuable insights to help dealmakers act with confidence in what we expect to be a more active year for M&A ahead.

Global Consumer & Retail M&A Outlook 2025
KPMG. Make the Difference. 
KPMG International | kpmg.com/globalconsumerretailMAoutlook2025
 
Foreword
While the trading environment should generally improve in 2025, 
C&R executives are facing a more complex landscape of different 
growth trajectories between individual economies, changing consumer 
preferences and emerging risks that are creating significant challenges to 
their operating models. 
For many sub-sectors, volume growth will come second to volume 
preservation. Facing pressure on consumer spend from declines in 
disposable incomes, shifts towards unbranded products and waning 
product loyalty, many consumer goods companies are struggling to 
arrest declining volumes. For large companies reliant on high sales 
volumes across a broad portfolio to generate the economies of scale 
that underpin margin growth, this decline in volumes is particularly 
challenging. Investor scrutiny is intense leading to significant turnover 
in the senior management of many larger players in the sector as 
organizations struggle to deliver combined sales and margin growth in 
this environment. 
Traditionally, companies in this sector have maintained large 
portfolios within aligned categories to help drive volumes, even 
though profitability tends to decline as you move down the portfolio 
tail. However, emerging risks such as reputational damage, cyber 
vulnerabilities, and ESG compliance costs are becoming increasingly 
concentrated in the smaller, less profitable entities that operate on 
legacy systems or remain partially integrated acquisitions, creating 
Having navigated the complexities of post-COVID supply chain shocks and input inflation which required significant pricing action, Consumer and Retail (C&R) CEOs are back to 
focusing on delivering much-needed volume growth. And, according to our most recent Global C&R CEO Outlook report, they are willing to pursue both organic and inorganic 
paths to deliver it.

backdoor vulnerabilities that expose the entire portfolio to potential 
risk. As a result, the historical approach of tolerating lower profitability 
in the tail is increasingly being challenged. Executives are now 
rethinking portfolio strategies to better balance risk and reward, 
ensuring that the cost of managing these risks does not outweigh 
the benefits of maintaining the portfolio’s breadth. 
Under-performance by some players has caught the attention of activist 
investors who have started to put pressure on consumer and retail 
companies to divest their non-core assets. From a capital markets 
perspective, we see an increasing penalty being placed on companies 
that show any ambiguity in their corporate strategy — whether that be 
at the portfolio, geographic, technological or sustainability level. Those 
that pick a lane and ruthlessly execute on it are outperforming their less 
focused peers. 
While all these factors point to a more active M&A environment 
in 2025, the big wild card is uncertainty surrounding the impact of 
geopolitics and ESG policies on the C&R sector. The looming threat 
and uncertainty of tariffs and regional divergence in the application of 
an evolving ESG landscape is creating competitive disparities and new 
complexities. Based on the current trends, there is a real risk that C&R 
companies will get caught in the political crossfire, no matter which 
direction they turn. This, in turn, could result in increased M&A activity 
as players move to decouple operations in specific geographies to 
reduce their geopolitical exposure.
Looking ahead, we expect 2025 to be characterized by a more ruthless 
review of dilutive and non-core businesses as organizations focus on 
their core. Alongside strategic divestments, expect to see significant 
bolt-on activity as organizations look for lower-risk, above-average 
growth opportunities. Large-scale M&A activity will be back on the table 
(if it offers compelling cost synergies) with expected changes at the 
Federal Trade Commission under the new administration also boosting 
investor and corporate confidence in larger transactions. 
However, activity will vary by region and by sector. This report explores 
the key trends influencing C&R M&A markets in 2025 and beyond. 
Given the rapid pace of change, both within the sector and across the 
global economy, understanding the trends will likely be key to unlocking 
value, driving growth and enabling transformation for dealmakers. We 
hope this report provides valuable insights to help dealmakers act with 
confidence in what we expect to be a more active year for M&A ahead. 
To learn more about the topics raised in this report, or to discuss your 
organization’s deal strategy and opportunities, we encourage you to 
contact your local KPMG member firm.

Strengthening the core: Global Consumer & Retail M&A Outlook 2025
 
Global M&A deal volume continues to decline; however, improvement can be 
seen in 2024 deal values with some high-value deals. The average deal size in 2024 
stands at $142M vs $90M in 2023.
Facing significant market uncertainty and slow economic growth coupled with unfavorable interest rate 
environment, many dealmakers stood on the sidelines of the M&A markets in 2024. Investors saw 
unbridgeable gaps in buy/ask valuations. CEOs were focused on business continuity, cost cutting and 
efficiencies. Debt was difficult to access outside of high-quality assets, and due diligence processes were 
becoming longer and more complex. 
As a result, 2024 saw global Consumer & Retail M&A deal volume fall 11 percent  year-on-year1, dropping 
below pre-pandemic averages.Volumes were down across all regions, with Asia Pacific seeing  
an 8 percent drop, versus a 13 percent fall in the Americas and a 12 percent drop in Europe, the Middle 
East and Africa1.

Key deals, 2024
Top countries’ deal volume and YoY growth, 2024
Cumulative deal values started the year with a concerning decline but bounced back in the third and fourth 
quarters thanks to a handful of large deals. Overall, values were up 35 percent1 over the prior year. 
Outside of a handful of larger transactions, the activity that did occur tended to involve distressed assets 
and non-core disposals. Some were companies that had been propped up by government handouts during 
the pandemic and low-cost debt in the aftermath and were now in financial distress. That resulted in 
companies reducing their footprints as well as some brands being acquired without their retail operations. 
In other cases, companies were disposing of non-core assets in an effort to focus on the core, reshape 
their portfolios and achieve transformation. 
While the year may have started off cautiously, there were signs of a coming revival mid-year. Drops in key 
interest rate levels (particularly in the Americas) boosted investor confidence and activity. The culmination 
of a set of elections worldwide provided more certainty. The cost of debt and capital started to decrease. 
And activity picked up pace in the fourth quarter. 
As the next chapter notes, many of these trends will likely continue into 2025. Dealmakers may want to 
prepare for a heightened pace of activity and competition for assets.

Core is the deal
C&R companies will likely look at evaluating their portfolios and divesting non-core assets, product lines 
and subsidiaries that do not align with their long-term strategic objectives while retaining higher-performing, 
profitable brands with strong customer recognition. Facing pressure to consolidate to sustain margins, 
expect to see players carve out and divest businesses that do not meet their margin targets in order to 
reinvest resources into core growth segments. Geopolitical considerations are also bringing a new lens to 
the review of what is core by C&R companies. We expect some movement as players move to ringfence 
specific geographical assets away from the rest of their operations.
Based on 2024 results, together with KPMG professional’s discussions and work with C&R dealmakers around the world, here are five key trends that should drive 
dealmaking in 2025:

Change in leadership
2024 saw leadership changes at many large players in the C&R space. Change in leadership often 
brings a refocusing of attention with resources and capital flowing towards key focus areas while non-
core segments are divested. Our analysis suggests these new leaders are particularly keen on bolt-on 
acquisitions as they seek to stabilize their businesses.
Bolt-on acquisitions
Anticipating continued economic uncertainty and where risk appetite is limited, expect to see an uptick in 
bolt-on acquisitions as investors look to deploy capital with lower risk. Facing a less favorable economic 
climate for risk taking and expansion into new categories, bolt-ons have been growing as a share of total 
acquisitions by large players, allowing them to invest into stable, predicable assets that are already familiar 
and where trust in the existing platform’s management team is high. Expect this trend to continue into 2025.

Key trends for 2025
 
Activist pressure
Across all sectors, activist investors increased their stakes in large cap companies by 37 percent, year-
over-year with the C&R sector receiving particular attention. In 2024, activist investors pressured some big 
players — including Kellanova, Kenvue and Starbucks — to streamline their businesses by divesting assets, 
making operational changes and pivoting strategic directions. Expect more of this in 2025 as activists look at 
other players with unaddressed value creation opportunities where they can deploy a similar playbook.
Emerging direct investors
The past year saw new investors move more aggressively into deal markets — particularly sovereign wealth 
funds (SWFs) looking to make direct investments into areas like casual dining, online retail and food retail. While 
many of these investments were made alongside private equity players in which the SWF was also an investor, 
the inclusion of new investors is stimulating deal activity within the sector, creating competition over deals. 
Expect to see investors sharpen their deal strategies and enhance their regional relationships as they move to 
cater to this investor class in their M&A process.

Food and beverage 
Appetite should return in 2025
Deal volume grew by 0.2 percent1 year-over-year in 2024. And while cumulative deal value 
nearly doubled versus the previous year, that was largely on the back of Mars’ announced 
acquisition of Kellanova for US$35 billion2 — the largest deal of the year for the C&R sector as 
a whole. With significant disruption still on the horizon for the Food & Beverage sector, expect 
organizations to place renewed focus on supply chain optimization — implementing integrated 
supply chain systems for real-time visibility, collaborating with suppliers to improve operational 
efficiency and incorporating sustainability practices to reduce environmental impact.
One trend likely to continue is the shift towards health and wellness-related products. 
Prompted by the pandemic and energized by the launch of new weight loss drugs, consumers 
are becoming increasingly focused on their health, leading many Food & Beverage companies 
to invest into new products and categories. Depending on a host of individual factors, from 
weight-loss motivation to income to nutritional knowledge, these medications may cause 
a user to spend less, the same, or even more on food than they did before starting the 
medication. Given that the global GLP-1 market is set to grow at around 30 percent CAGR 
through 2030,3  food and beverage retailers will want to consider the impact of these drugs on 
their product formulations and portfolios. 
The trend towards health is playing out in different ways across sectors. On the one hand, we 
see an increasing interest in health-conscious beverages, particularly from Gen Z consumers. 
On the other, we have seen the plant based and alternative protein sub sector cool, with 
valuations falling significantly. 
As such, anticipate a flurry of new deals to come to market as C&R players refocus on the 
core and divest of non-core categories and geographies. Some of this activity will be to 
achieve cost optimization and shore up margins. But many will also be trying to adjust their 
footprints to reflect new international trade dynamics, unlock market access and reduce their 
geopolitical risk.

Retail 
A dynamic year ahead 
Retail deal markets were relatively quiet in 2024 with non-food retail deal volumes down  
14 percent1 and food retail volumes down 3 percent1. Yet there are signs that 2025 will see a 
notable uptick in activity across retail sectors. Indeed, with lower inflation, stabilized interest 
rates and improved consumer confidence, 2025 is poised to be a dynamic year for retail M&A.
Consolidation and portfolio diversification were big drivers of deal activity in 2024, especially in 
food retail. Expect that to continue into 2025 as some companies divest non-core assets and 
segments and others look to strengthen existing offerings with complementary assets and 
expand into new markets, particularly where consumer demand is rising. A number of high-
profile transactions in this sector were blocked by regulators and conduct authorities in 2024. 
However, there is an expectation that, with the new US administration, a more favorable 
environment for consolidation transactions will prevail.
2025 should bring a further wave of strategic acquisitions as companies and investors look 
to enhance their digital and omnichannel capabilities (primarily focused on integrating AI and 
improving e-commerce offerings) and drive seamless integration between online and physical 
store experiences, especially in the non-food retail sector. Retailers with strong real estate 
portfolios will leverage prime locations to enhance brand presence and customer experience.
A recent uptick in deals that enhance acquirer sustainability in some way — through 
operational efficiency, waste reduction or supply chain resilience, for example — could also 
help encourage a lift in activity in 2025, but we have a major question as to whether this trend 
will sustain given the shifting geopolitical backdrop to this topic.  
Despite lower deal volumes in 2024, a number of high-ticket acquisitions underscored the 
appetite for transformative transactions, a trend likely to persist in 2025 as retailers prioritize 
investment into innovation, sustainability and market positioning to achieve their growth 
trajectory.

Home and personal care 
Investors look for financial and environmental sustainability 
Dealmakers continued to sit on the sidelines in the home and personal care sector, driving deal 
volume down 13 percent and cumulative values down 41 percent1 — the fourth annual decline in both 
measures since 2021. Activity was led by the personal care segment which racked up 52 percent1 of 
the sector’s total volume, led by notable deals in the hair care and affordable skin care segments. 
Macroeconomic factors continue to influence growth in the sector. Recent rises in the cost of living 
coupled with higher interest rates are depressing discretionary spending — particularly for bigger 
ticket items. Concerns about tariffs are dampening investment plans. Slow economic growth in key 
markets such as Germany and China is influencing investor confidence. 
Home and personal care is expected to experience some portfolio optimization as leaders rethink 
their growth strategies, markets and product selection to adjust for a more challenging and disruptive 
economic environment. That has led to a growing stream of divestments (such as Procter & Gamble’s 
divestment of their Chinese hair care business to Henkel AG & Co4) as organizations shed non-core 
and low-growth businesses to focus on improving margins and expanding their core business.
Rising consumer preference for environmentally-friendly brands and sustainable products should 
also bring more activity to the deal markets. The challenge is that demand for high-quality, all-natural 
products is still somewhat inelastic. Squeezing further margin growth post-deal is not always easy. 
And that is leading dealmakers in the sector to look for targets in growing markets and underserved 
categories. 
Compared to other C&R sectors, dealmaking in the home and personal care segment may remain 
slow in the first half of 2025 as investors and PE managers focus on higher growth sub sectors 
such as Beauty, which is forecasted to grow by 8.4 percent CAGR through 2028 (according to 
Euromonitor), reflecting strong market growth amongst the GenZ consumer segment. Expect 2025 
to be a turnaround year, characterized by measurable growth in both deal volumes and values.

Pet care 
Consumer spending wags the dog
Amidst the isolation of the pandemic, demand for pet care products skyrocketed and deal 
activity quickly went through the roof. With life now returned to (fairly) normal, spending on 
pet care has fallen. So, too, has deal activity. Year-on-year, activity fell 21 percent1. 
In many ways, consumer preferences and shifts in buying behavior are leading to slower 
growth in some segments. Data suggests that pet owners are shifting their priorities away 
from toys and towards nutrition. That means less foot traffic in physical stores and a decline in 
margins as consumers shop around for the best price on their everyday pet food. This not only 
underscores the growing significance of online sales but also reinforces that businesses need 
to adapt to a multi-channel proposition.
On the other hand, these trends are also driving strong growth in online sales, as well as 
health related businesses such as veterinary care and nutritious food. Expect 2025 to bring a 
rise in deal activity in these spaces as bigger players expand their footprints into higher-margin 
foods and broader positioning within the pet ecosystem. At the same time, however, we are 
seeing many investors pause their bolt-on activity in the veterinary services segment, due to 
growing focus from competition authorities on this sub sector. 
Despite many consumers having lower disposable income, spending on pets increased 
among high-income households. The trend towards the humanization of animals leads to 
a greater desire to provide them with high-quality, nutritious foods. Expect to see growth 
in demand and in deal activity for assets offering fresh, frozen and freeze-dried premium 
products to high-end customer segments.

Luxury goods 
Economic uncertainty keeps buyers on the sidelines
With the potential for a long trade war between the US and China increasing and declining 
demand for luxury goods in Chinese markets, 2024 saw deal activity fall across the segment. 
Volume dropped 38 percent year-on-year1; cumulative values were down 35 percent1. 
Interestingly, private equity was more active in this segment, succeeding on the buyside in 6 
of the 34 deals1 announced in the year, suggesting managers see value opportunities in the 
sector going forward. 
M&A activity in the Beauty and Cosmetic business has been boosted by lower valuations 
in China, creating opportunities for buyers. Additionally in Korea, where K-beauty remains 
attractive, 2024 witnessed notable transactions, including Dr.G being bought by L’Oréal. 
M&A in luxury goods is shifting toward client experience-focused segments. This means 
companies are moving away from product-based acquisitions and focusing more on 
experience-based assets, such as light clinical beauty  and high-end hospitality, which align 
with changing consumer preferences.
As market leaders start to adjust to a more challenging economic and geopolitical 
environment, expect to see some luxury goods companies and investors ramp up their focus 
on portfolio consolidation and streamlining operations, driven by a desire to focus on the core 
business, unlock efficiencies and enhance resilience and agility. This should lead to increased 
deal activity as some players divest assets and others acquire them in order to expand their 
offerings, tap into new customer segments and markets, as well as bring an experience 
element to the portfolio. 
Ultimately, the deal outlook for the luxury goods segment is largely dependent on the 
macroeconomic environment. Few sectors are as exposed to economic disruption as luxury 
goods. The prospect of trade wars (which often hit luxury goods first), increased geopolitical 
tension and slow economic growth in 2025 will likely keep investors cautious.

Discover the latest insights into consumer retail trends and the dynamic landscape of retail M&A as we dive into a broad market analysis for 2025. With the retail industry facing significant challenges, our analysis reveals that major shifts in valuations, due diligence, and post-merger integration are on the horizon.
Having navigated the complexities of post-covid supply chain shocks and input inflation which required significant pricing action, Consumer and Retail (C&R) CEOs are back to focusing on delivering much-needed volume growth.
Yet, for many sub-sectors, volume growth will come second to volume preservation. Facing pressure on consumer spend from declines in disposable incomes, shifts towards unbranded products and waning product loyalty, many consumer goods companies are struggling to arrest declining volumes.
Looking ahead, we expect 2025 to be characterised by a more ruthless review of dilutive and non-core businesses as organisations focus on their core. However, activity will vary by region and by sector. Alongside strategic divestments, expect to see significant bolt-on activity as organisations look for lower-risk, above-average growth opportunities.
This report provides valuable insights to help dealmakers act with confidence in what we expect to be a more active year for M&A ahead.

C&R companies will look at evaluating their portfolios and divesting non-core assets, product lines and subsidiaries that do not align with their long-term strategic objectives.
2024 saw leadership changes at many large players in the C&R space and our analysis suggests these new leaders are particularly keen on bolt-on acquisitions.
Anticipating continued economic uncertainty and where risk appetite is limited, expect to see an uptick in bolt-on acquisitions.
Expect more activist investor attention on the C&R sector in 2025 as activists look at other players with unaddressed value creation opportunities.
With new direct investors such as Sovereign Wealth Funds moving more aggressively into deal markets, expect greater competition for deals.
For many sub-sectors, volume growth will come second to preservation. See the M&A deal activity trends from 2018–2024 in the sectors analysis.
Anticipate a flurry of new deals to come to market as C&R players refocus on the core and divest of non-core categories and geographies. Some of this activity will be to achieve cost optimisation and shore up margins. But many will also be trying to adjust their footprints to reflect new international trade dynamics, unlock market access and reduce their geopolitical risk.
Despite lower deal volumes in 2024, 2025 should bring a further wave of strategic acquisitions as companies and investors look to enhance their digital and omnichannel capabilities (primarily focused on integrating AI and improving e-commerce offerings) and drive seamless integration between online and physical store experiences, especially in the non-food retail sector.
Compared to other C&R sectors, dealmaking in the home and personal care segment may remain slow in the first half of 2025 as investors and PE managers focus on higher growth sub sectors. But expect 2025 to be a turnaround year, characterised by measurable growth in both deal volumes and values.
Despite many consumers having lower disposable income, spending on pets increased among high-income households. The trend towards the humanisation of animals leads to a greater desire to provide them with high-quality, nutritious foods. Expect to see growth in demand and in deal activity for assets offering fresh, frozen and freeze-dried premium products to high-end customer segments.
Ultimately, the deal outlook for the luxury goods segment is largely dependent on the macroeconomic environment. Few sectors are as exposed to economic disruption as luxury goods.

Global Consumer & Retail M&A Outlook 2025
KPMG. Make the Difference.

Foreword
While the trading environment should generally improve in 2025, 
C&R executives are facing a more complex landscape of different 
growth trajectories between individual economies, changing consumer 
preferences and emerging risks that are creating significant challenges to 
their operating models. 
For many sub-sectors, volume growth will come second to volume 
preservation. Facing pressure on consumer spend from declines in 
disposable incomes, shifts towards unbranded products and waning 
product loyalty, many consumer goods companies are struggling to 
arrest declining volumes. For large companies reliant on high sales 
volumes across a broad portfolio to generate the economies of scale 
that underpin margin growth, this decline in volumes is particularly 
challenging. Investor scrutiny is intense leading to significant turnover 
in the senior management of many larger players in the sector as 
organizations struggle to deliver combined sales and margin growth in 
this environment. 
Traditionally, companies in this sector have maintained large 
portfolios within aligned categories to help drive volumes, even 
though profitability tends to decline as you move down the portfolio 
tail. However, emerging risks such as reputational damage, cyber 
vulnerabilities, and ESG compliance costs are becoming increasingly 
concentrated in the smaller, less profitable entities that operate on 
legacy systems or remain partially integrated acquisitions, creating 
Having navigated the complexities of post-COVID supply chain shocks and input inflation which required significant pricing action, Consumer and Retail (C&R) CEOs are back to 
focusing on delivering much-needed volume growth. And, according to our most recent Global C&R CEO Outlook report, they are willing to pursue both organic and inorganic 
paths to deliver it.

backdoor vulnerabilities that expose the entire portfolio to potential 
risk. As a result, the historical approach of tolerating lower profitability 
in the tail is increasingly being challenged. Executives are now 
rethinking portfolio strategies to better balance risk and reward, 
ensuring that the cost of managing these risks does not outweigh 
the benefits of maintaining the portfolio’s breadth. 
Under-performance by some players has caught the attention of activist 
investors who have started to put pressure on consumer and retail 
companies to divest their non-core assets. From a capital markets 
perspective, we see an increasing penalty being placed on companies 
that show any ambiguity in their corporate strategy — whether that be 
at the portfolio, geographic, technological or sustainability level. Those 
that pick a lane and ruthlessly execute on it are outperforming their less 
focused peers. 
While all these factors point to a more active M&A environment 
in 2025, the big wild card is uncertainty surrounding the impact of 
geopolitics and ESG policies on the C&R sector. The looming threat 
and uncertainty of tariffs and regional divergence in the application of 
an evolving ESG landscape is creating competitive disparities and new 
complexities. Based on the current trends, there is a real risk that C&R 
companies will get caught in the political crossfire, no matter which 
direction they turn. This, in turn, could result in increased M&A activity 
as players move to decouple operations in specific geographies to 
reduce their geopolitical exposure.
Looking ahead, we expect 2025 to be characterized by a more ruthless 
review of dilutive and non-core businesses as organizations focus on 
their core. Alongside strategic divestments, expect to see significant 
bolt-on activity as organizations look for lower-risk, above-average 
growth opportunities. Large-scale M&A activity will be back on the table 
(if it offers compelling cost synergies) with expected changes at the 
Federal Trade Commission under the new administration also boosting 
investor and corporate confidence in larger transactions. 
However, activity will vary by region and by sector. This report explores 
the key trends influencing C&R M&A markets in 2025 and beyond. 
Given the rapid pace of change, both within the sector and across the 
global economy, understanding the trends will likely be key to unlocking 
value, driving growth and enabling transformation for dealmakers. We 
hope this report provides valuable insights to help dealmakers act with 
confidence in what we expect to be a more active year for M&A ahead. 
To learn more about the topics raised in this report, or to discuss your 
organization’s deal strategy and opportunities, we encourage you to 
contact your local KPMG member firm.

Strengthening the core: Global Consumer & Retail M&A Outlook 2025
 
Global M&A deal volume continues to decline; however, improvement can be 
seen in 2024 deal values with some high-value deals. The average deal size in 2024 
stands at $142M vs $90M in 2023.
Facing significant market uncertainty and slow economic growth coupled with unfavorable interest rate 
environment, many dealmakers stood on the sidelines of the M&A markets in 2024. Investors saw 
unbridgeable gaps in buy/ask valuations. CEOs were focused on business continuity, cost cutting and 
efficiencies. Debt was difficult to access outside of high-quality assets, and due diligence processes were 
becoming longer and more complex. 
As a result, 2024 saw global Consumer & Retail M&A deal volume fall 11 percent  year-on-year1, dropping 
below pre-pandemic averages.Volumes were down across all regions, with Asia Pacific seeing  
an 8 percent drop, versus a 13 percent fall in the Americas and a 12 percent drop in Europe, the Middle 
East and Africa1.

Key deals, 2024
Top countries’ deal volume and YoY growth, 2024
Cumulative deal values started the year with a concerning decline but bounced back in the third and fourth 
quarters thanks to a handful of large deals. Overall, values were up 35 percent1 over the prior year. 
Outside of a handful of larger transactions, the activity that did occur tended to involve distressed assets 
and non-core disposals. Some were companies that had been propped up by government handouts during 
the pandemic and low-cost debt in the aftermath and were now in financial distress. That resulted in 
companies reducing their footprints as well as some brands being acquired without their retail operations. 
In other cases, companies were disposing of non-core assets in an effort to focus on the core, reshape 
their portfolios and achieve transformation. 
While the year may have started off cautiously, there were signs of a coming revival mid-year. Drops in key 
interest rate levels (particularly in the Americas) boosted investor confidence and activity. The culmination 
of a set of elections worldwide provided more certainty. The cost of debt and capital started to decrease. 
And activity picked up pace in the fourth quarter. 
As the next chapter notes, many of these trends will likely continue into 2025. Dealmakers may want to 
prepare for a heightened pace of activity and competition for assets.

Core is the deal
C&R companies will likely look at evaluating their portfolios and divesting non-core assets, product lines 
and subsidiaries that do not align with their long-term strategic objectives while retaining higher-performing, 
profitable brands with strong customer recognition. Facing pressure to consolidate to sustain margins, 
expect to see players carve out and divest businesses that do not meet their margin targets in order to 
reinvest resources into core growth segments. Geopolitical considerations are also bringing a new lens to 
the review of what is core by C&R companies. We expect some movement as players move to ringfence 
specific geographical assets away from the rest of their operations.
Based on 2024 results, together with KPMG professional’s discussions and work with C&R dealmakers around the world, here are five key trends that should drive 
dealmaking in 2025:

Change in leadership
2024 saw leadership changes at many large players in the C&R space. Change in leadership often 
brings a refocusing of attention with resources and capital flowing towards key focus areas while non-
core segments are divested. Our analysis suggests these new leaders are particularly keen on bolt-on 
acquisitions as they seek to stabilize their businesses.
Bolt-on acquisitions
Anticipating continued economic uncertainty and where risk appetite is limited, expect to see an uptick in 
bolt-on acquisitions as investors look to deploy capital with lower risk. Facing a less favorable economic 
climate for risk taking and expansion into new categories, bolt-ons have been growing as a share of total 
acquisitions by large players, allowing them to invest into stable, predicable assets that are already familiar 
and where trust in the existing platform’s management team is high. Expect this trend to continue into 2025.

Activist pressure
Across all sectors, activist investors increased their stakes in large cap companies by 37 percent, year-
over-year with the C&R sector receiving particular attention. In 2024, activist investors pressured some big 
players — including Kellanova, Kenvue and Starbucks — to streamline their businesses by divesting assets, 
making operational changes and pivoting strategic directions. Expect more of this in 2025 as activists look at 
other players with unaddressed value creation opportunities where they can deploy a similar playbook.
Emerging direct investors
The past year saw new investors move more aggressively into deal markets — particularly sovereign wealth 
funds (SWFs) looking to make direct investments into areas like casual dining, online retail and food retail. While 
many of these investments were made alongside private equity players in which the SWF was also an investor, 
the inclusion of new investors is stimulating deal activity within the sector, creating competition over deals. 
Expect to see investors sharpen their deal strategies and enhance their regional relationships as they move to 
cater to this investor class in their M&A process.

Food and beverage 
Appetite should return in 2025
Deal volume grew by 0.2 percent1 year-over-year in 2024. And while cumulative deal value 
nearly doubled versus the previous year, that was largely on the back of Mars’ announced 
acquisition of Kellanova for US$35 billion2 — the largest deal of the year for the C&R sector as 
a whole. With significant disruption still on the horizon for the Food & Beverage sector, expect 
organizations to place renewed focus on supply chain optimization — implementing integrated 
supply chain systems for real-time visibility, collaborating with suppliers to improve operational 
efficiency and incorporating sustainability practices to reduce environmental impact.
One trend likely to continue is the shift towards health and wellness-related products. 
Prompted by the pandemic and energized by the launch of new weight loss drugs, consumers 
are becoming increasingly focused on their health, leading many Food & Beverage companies 
to invest into new products and categories. Depending on a host of individual factors, from 
weight-loss motivation to income to nutritional knowledge, these medications may cause 
a user to spend less, the same, or even more on food than they did before starting the 
medication. Given that the global GLP-1 market is set to grow at around 30 percent CAGR 
through 2030,3  food and beverage retailers will want to consider the impact of these drugs on 
their product formulations and portfolios. 
The trend towards health is playing out in different ways across sectors. On the one hand, we 
see an increasing interest in health-conscious beverages, particularly from Gen Z consumers. 
On the other, we have seen the plant based and alternative protein sub sector cool, with 
valuations falling significantly. 
As such, anticipate a flurry of new deals to come to market as C&R players refocus on the 
core and divest of non-core categories and geographies. Some of this activity will be to 
achieve cost optimization and shore up margins. But many will also be trying to adjust their 
footprints to reflect new international trade dynamics, unlock market access and reduce their 
geopolitical risk.

Retail 
A dynamic year ahead 
Retail deal markets were relatively quiet in 2024 with non-food retail deal volumes down  
14 percent1 and food retail volumes down 3 percent1. Yet there are signs that 2025 will see a 
notable uptick in activity across retail sectors. Indeed, with lower inflation, stabilized interest 
rates and improved consumer confidence, 2025 is poised to be a dynamic year for retail M&A.
Consolidation and portfolio diversification were big drivers of deal activity in 2024, especially in 
food retail. Expect that to continue into 2025 as some companies divest non-core assets and 
segments and others look to strengthen existing offerings with complementary assets and 
expand into new markets, particularly where consumer demand is rising. A number of high-
profile transactions in this sector were blocked by regulators and conduct authorities in 2024. 
However, there is an expectation that, with the new US administration, a more favorable 
environment for consolidation transactions will prevail.
2025 should bring a further wave of strategic acquisitions as companies and investors look 
to enhance their digital and omnichannel capabilities (primarily focused on integrating AI and 
improving e-commerce offerings) and drive seamless integration between online and physical 
store experiences, especially in the non-food retail sector. Retailers with strong real estate 
portfolios will leverage prime locations to enhance brand presence and customer experience.
A recent uptick in deals that enhance acquirer sustainability in some way — through 
operational efficiency, waste reduction or supply chain resilience, for example — could also 
help encourage a lift in activity in 2025, but we have a major question as to whether this trend 
will sustain given the shifting geopolitical backdrop to this topic.  
Despite lower deal volumes in 2024, a number of high-ticket acquisitions underscored the 
appetite for transformative transactions, a trend likely to persist in 2025 as retailers prioritize 
investment into innovation, sustainability and market positioning to achieve their growth 
trajectory.

Home and personal care 
Investors look for financial and environmental sustainability 
Dealmakers continued to sit on the sidelines in the home and personal care sector, driving deal 
volume down 13 percent and cumulative values down 41 percent1 — the fourth annual decline in both 
measures since 2021. Activity was led by the personal care segment which racked up 52 percent1 of 
the sector’s total volume, led by notable deals in the hair care and affordable skin care segments. 
Macroeconomic factors continue to influence growth in the sector. Recent rises in the cost of living 
coupled with higher interest rates are depressing discretionary spending — particularly for bigger 
ticket items. Concerns about tariffs are dampening investment plans. Slow economic growth in key 
markets such as Germany and China is influencing investor confidence. 
Home and personal care is expected to experience some portfolio optimization as leaders rethink 
their growth strategies, markets and product selection to adjust for a more challenging and disruptive 
economic environment. That has led to a growing stream of divestments (such as Procter & Gamble’s 
divestment of their Chinese hair care business to Henkel AG & Co4) as organizations shed non-core 
and low-growth businesses to focus on improving margins and expanding their core business.
Rising consumer preference for environmentally-friendly brands and sustainable products should 
also bring more activity to the deal markets. The challenge is that demand for high-quality, all-natural 
products is still somewhat inelastic. Squeezing further margin growth post-deal is not always easy. 
And that is leading dealmakers in the sector to look for targets in growing markets and underserved 
categories. 
Compared to other C&R sectors, dealmaking in the home and personal care segment may remain 
slow in the first half of 2025 as investors and PE managers focus on higher growth sub sectors 
such as Beauty, which is forecasted to grow by 8.4 percent CAGR through 2028 (according to 
Euromonitor), reflecting strong market growth amongst the GenZ consumer segment. Expect 2025 
to be a turnaround year, characterized by measurable growth in both deal volumes and values.

Pet care 
Consumer spending wags the dog
Amidst the isolation of the pandemic, demand for pet care products skyrocketed and deal 
activity quickly went through the roof. With life now returned to (fairly) normal, spending on 
pet care has fallen. So, too, has deal activity. Year-on-year, activity fell 21 percent1. 
In many ways, consumer preferences and shifts in buying behavior are leading to slower 
growth in some segments. Data suggests that pet owners are shifting their priorities away 
from toys and towards nutrition. That means less foot traffic in physical stores and a decline in 
margins as consumers shop around for the best price on their everyday pet food. This not only 
underscores the growing significance of online sales but also reinforces that businesses need 
to adapt to a multi-channel proposition.
On the other hand, these trends are also driving strong growth in online sales, as well as 
health related businesses such as veterinary care and nutritious food. Expect 2025 to bring a 
rise in deal activity in these spaces as bigger players expand their footprints into higher-margin 
foods and broader positioning within the pet ecosystem. At the same time, however, we are 
seeing many investors pause their bolt-on activity in the veterinary services segment, due to 
growing focus from competition authorities on this sub sector. 
Despite many consumers having lower disposable income, spending on pets increased 
among high-income households. The trend towards the humanization of animals leads to 
a greater desire to provide them with high-quality, nutritious foods. Expect to see growth 
in demand and in deal activity for assets offering fresh, frozen and freeze-dried premium 
products to high-end customer segments.

Luxury goods 
Economic uncertainty keeps buyers on the sidelines
With the potential for a long trade war between the US and China increasing and declining 
demand for luxury goods in Chinese markets, 2024 saw deal activity fall across the segment. 
Volume dropped 38 percent year-on-year1; cumulative values were down 35 percent1. 
Interestingly, private equity was more active in this segment, succeeding on the buyside in 6 
of the 34 deals1 announced in the year, suggesting managers see value opportunities in the 
sector going forward. 
M&A activity in the Beauty and Cosmetic business has been boosted by lower valuations 
in China, creating opportunities for buyers. Additionally in Korea, where K-beauty remains 
attractive, 2024 witnessed notable transactions, including Dr.G being bought by L’Oréal. 
M&A in luxury goods is shifting toward client experience-focused segments. This means 
companies are moving away from product-based acquisitions and focusing more on 
experience-based assets, such as light clinical beauty  and high-end hospitality, which align 
with changing consumer preferences.
As market leaders start to adjust to a more challenging economic and geopolitical 
environment, expect to see some luxury goods companies and investors ramp up their focus 
on portfolio consolidation and streamlining operations, driven by a desire to focus on the core 
business, unlock efficiencies and enhance resilience and agility. This should lead to increased 
deal activity as some players divest assets and others acquire them in order to expand their 
offerings, tap into new customer segments and markets, as well as bring an experience 
element to the portfolio. 
Ultimately, the deal outlook for the luxury goods segment is largely dependent on the 
macroeconomic environment. Few sectors are as exposed to economic disruption as luxury 
goods. The prospect of trade wars (which often hit luxury goods first), increased geopolitical 
tension and slow economic growth in 2025 will likely keep investors cautious.

KPMG Private Enterprise quarterly global report on venture capital trends
Share
VC investment globally increased between Q4’24 and Q1’25, driven in part by a large number of $1 billion+ megadeals, including a standout investment of $40 billion in OpenAI. Other big deals included Anthropic — $4.5 billion (two closings), Infinite Reality — $3 billion, Binance — $2 billion, Groq — $1.5 billion, DayOne — $1.2 billion, and X — $1 billion.

VC investment in the Americas surged in Q1 2025, driven by a series of megadeals, while Europe saw more muted growth and Asia experienced another quarterly decline, reaching record low investment levels. Deal volume dropped across all regions, as investors remained cautious amid macroeconomic uncertainty.
The US retained its position as the top destination for VC funding, bolstered by several high-profile raises, including OpenAI’s $40 billion raise, Anthropic’s $4.5 billion raise (two closings), and Infinite Reality’s $3 billion raise in the augmented reality space. Europe ranked second in total VC investment, led by Binance’s $2 billion raise — the region’s largest of the quarter — followed by German proptech firm Reneo, which secured $624 million. Asia’s VC market remained soft, with just three deals exceeding $500 million. Singapore-based datacentre firm DayOne led with a $1.2 billion raise, followed by China’s cleantech company SE Environmental ($688 million) and India-based e-commerce platform Meesho ($550 million).
AI plays continued to dominate the VC market in Q1’25. While the largest deals in the AI sector occurred in the US led, by OpenAI, Anthropic and Infinite Reality, other regions also saw robust AI investments. In Europe, AI-enabled industry solutions companies raised a number of $100 million funding rounds, including Sweden-based preventative healthtech company Neko Health ($260 million) and UK-based AI-powered video communications company Synthesia ($180 million). Asia also saw a number of significant AI-focused raises, including China-based Neolix Technologies ($137 million) and Univista ($137 million), Australia-based Harrison.ai ($111 million), Hong Kong (SAR) and Boston-based InSilico Medicine ($100 million), and India-based Spotdraft ($54 million).
Looking at the AI space more broadly, the launch of China-based DeepSeek’s R1 AI model sent ripples across the globe in Q1’25. DeepSeek’s launch was followed closely by new AI models by Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba. The launch of the three models so close together — all purporting to be more energy efficient than others built to date — highlights the intense competition globally and regionally for market dominance in the large language model (LLM) space.
As competition heated up in the AI space worldwide, a number of governments made substantive moves in order to promote, encourage, and accelerate AI development. During the quarter, the US announced The Stargate Project, which aims to spend $500 billion on developing next gen AI infrastructure in the US.1
This was followed by the European Commission’s announcement of its InvestAI program2— a plan to drive $206 billion into AI innovation, including the development of gigafactories — and France’s announcement of $112 billion in AI investment commitments.3During the quarter, China also announced a $138 billion national venture capital guidance fund to invest in a range of priority sectors, including AI and quantum computing.4
Interest in defense tech continued to grow in Q1’25, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions. The US saw the largest defense tech deals during the quarter, including a $600 million raise by Saronic Technologies, a $240 million raise by ShieldAI, and a $250 million raise by Epirus. Spacetech also continued to grow on the radar of investors. Japan in particular saw several deals during the quarter, including raises by ArkEdge Space ($51 million) and Interstellar Technologies ($45 million).

Heading into Q2’25, AI is expected to remain the primary driver of VC investment globally. Industry-focused AI solutions are likely to attract growing interest, alongside advanced robotics and enabling technologies such as LIDAR. Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, sectors like defence-tech and cybersecurity are also projected to see increased VC activity.
However, VC investment may begin the quarter on a slower note as investors await greater clarity on the escalating global trade war and its potential economic ramifications. Global M&A activity could accelerate in Q2’25 and beyond, particularly in the AI space, as major tech companies seek to acquire promising startups before valuations rise further. The recently announced $32 billion deal for Google to acquire Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz — announced prior to the U.S. administration’s tariff announcements — may serve as a catalyst for increased M&A activity, particularly within the cybersecurity and broader tech sectors. In the face of continued IPO uncertainty, M&A remains a compelling alternative for companies seeking strategic exits.

Welcome message
Welcome to the Q1’25 edition of KPMG Private Enterprise’s Venture 
Pulse — a quarterly report highlighting the major trends, challenges, 
and opportunities facing the venture capital market globally and in key 
jurisdictions around the world.
Against a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and renewed concerns 
over tariffs and trade tensions, global VC investment rose from
$118 billion in Q4’24 to $126 billion in Q1’25, fueled by a wave of 
megadeals — including eight $1 billion+ transactions and a standout 
$40 billion raise by OpenAI.
Despite the uptick in investment value, deal volume declined quarter-
over-quarter as many VC investors paused to evaluate whether 
market shifts were temporary and to preserve capital in light of 
ongoing IPO exit delays. Deal-making also slowed as firms adapted to 
evolving investment considerations.
The Americas attracted the largest share of VC investment globally 
during the quarter. The US accounted for the bulk of this investment, 
including a $40 billion standout deal by OpenAI, a $4.5 billion raise by 
Anthropic (two closings) and a $3 billion raise by Infinite Reality. VC 
investment in Europe remained flat quarter-over-quarter at $18 billion, 
led by a massive $2 billion deal by cryptocurrency exchange Binance, 
followed by Germany-based energy management proptech Reneo 
($624 million) and UK-based AI drug discovery firm Isomorphic Labs 
($600 million).  VC investment in Asia fell from $18.9 billion in Q4’24 to 
a record low $12.9 billion in Q1’25. Singapore-based data center firm 
DayOne raised the largest VC deal ($1.2 billion) of the quarter 
followed by Chinese cleantech SE Environmental ($688 million) and 
India-based e-commerce company Meesho ($550 million). 
AI remained the hottest ticket globally. In addition to large raises by 
LLM-focused companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, companies 
focused on AI applications (e.g. augmented reality, autonomous

vehicles, robotics) and industry solutions — such as AI for mining tech 
company Kobold Metals ($537 million) and AI preventative health 
company Cera ($150 million)—also saw significant investments. 
Defense Tech and spacetech also continued to gain traction with VC 
investors.
While there had been optimism that Q1’25 could mark a rebound in IPO 
activity in the US, lingering market uncertainties led many startups to 
delay their public debut plans. US-based AI infrastructure firm 
CoreWeave went public late in the quarter, though its relatively muted 
performance — and unique business model—meant it wasn’t seen as a 
reliable indicator for broader IPO sentiment. Sweden-based fintech 
Klarna had initially signaled plans for a Q1 IPO but ultimately postponed 
the offering. Its performance, should the IPO proceed in Q2, will be 
closely watched as a potential bellwether for other late-stage tech 
companies considering the public markets. 
The current levels of geopolitical uncertainty will likely continue to affect 
the VC market heading into Q2’25, although areas like AI, defense tech, 
cybersecurity, and alternative energy will likely remain resilient.
In this quarter’s edition of Venture Pulse, we examine these and a 
number of other global and regional trends, including:
•
The increasing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties
•
The expanding diversity of AI solutions attracting investments
•
The growing attention being given to defense tech and spacetech
•
The increasing involvement of governments in driving AI investments
We hope you find this edition of Venture Pulse insightful. If you would

Global VC investment falters amid fresh wave of uncertainty 
VC investment globally increased between Q4’24 and Q1’25, driven in part by a large number of $1 billion+ megadeals, including a standout investment of $40 billion in OpenAI. 
Other big deals included Anthropic — $4.5 billion (two closings), Infinite Reality — $3 billion, Binance — $2 billion, Groq — $1.5 billion, DayOne — $1.2 billion and X — $1 billion. 
US attracts over two-thirds of VC funding globally in Q1’25
VC investment in the Americas surged in Q1 2025, driven by a series of megadeals, while Europe 
saw more muted growth and Asia experienced another quarterly decline, reaching record low 
investment levels. Deal volume dropped across all regions, as investors remained cautious amid 
macroeconomic uncertainty.  
The US retained its position as the top destination for VC funding, bolstered by several high-profile 
raises, including OpenAI’s $40 billion raise, Anthropic’s $4.5 billion raise (two closings), and Infinite 
Reality’s $3 billion raise in the augmented reality space. Europe ranked second in total VC 
investment, led by Binance’s $2 billion raise — the region’s largest of the quarter — followed by 
German proptech firm Reneo, which secured $624 million. Asia’s VC market remained soft, with just 
three deals exceeding$500 million. Singapore-based datacentre firm DayOne led with a $1.2 billion 
raise, followed by China’s cleantech company SE Environmental ($688 million) and India-based 
e-commerce platform Meesho ($550 million).
Hot AI space attracting diversity of deals across jurisdictions
AI plays continued to dominate the VC market in Q1’25. While the largest deals in the AI sector 
occurred in the US led, by OpenAI, Anthropic and Infinite Reality, other regions also saw robust AI 
investments. In Europe, AI-enabled industry solutions companies raised a number of $100 million 
funding rounds, including Sweden-based preventative healthtech company Neko Health ($260 million) 
and UK-based AI-powered video communications company Synthesia ($180 million). Asia also saw a 
number of significant AI-focused raises, including China-based Neolix Technologies ($137 million) and 
Univista ($137 million), Australia-based Harrison.ai ($111 million), Hong Kong (SAR) and Boston-
based InSilico Medicine ($100 million), and India-based Spotdraft ($54 million).

4 https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-set-up-national-venture-capital-guidance-fund-state-planner-says-2025-03-06/
Looking at the AI space more broadly, the launch of China-based DeepSeek’s R1 AI model sent 
ripples across the globe in Q1’25. DeepSeek’s launch was followed closely by new AI models by 
Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba. The launch of the three models so close together — all 
purporting to be more energy efficient than others built to date — highlights the intense competition 
globally and regionally for market dominance in the large language model (LLM) space.
Geopolitical uncertainties and tensions driving VC investment into defense tech 
and spacetech
As competition heated up in the AI space worldwide, a number of governments made substantive 
moves in order to promote, encourage, and accelerate AI development. During the quarter, the US 
announced The Stargate Project, which aims to spend $500 billion on developing next-gen AI 
infrastructure in the US.1 This was followed by the European Commission’s announcement of its 
InvestAI program2  — a plan to drive $206 billion into AI innovation, including the development of 
gigafactories — and France’s announcement of $112 billion in AI investment commitments.3 During the 
quarter, China also announced a $138 billion national venture capital guidance fund to invest in a 
range of priority sectors, including AI and quantum computing.4
Alternative energy continues to attract interest globally
Interest in defense tech continued to grow in Q1’25, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions. The US 
saw the largest defense tech deals during the quarter, including a $600 million raise by Saronic 
Technologies, a $240 million raise by ShieldAI, and a $250 million raise by Epirus. Spacetech also 
continued to grow on the radar of investors. Japan in particular saw several deals during the quarter, 
including raises by ArkEdge Space ($51 million) and Interstellar Technologies ($45 million).

Global VC investment falters amid fresh wave of uncertainty, cont’d.
IPO market in US sees another setback amid new 
geopolitical uncertainties; HKSE sees some recovery
The hopeful optimism that characterized thoughts on the IPO market 
globally at the end of Q4’24 did not materialize in Q1’25. Concerns about 
tariffs and trade wars rose to the forefront of concerns, causing challenges 
across a number of stock markets globally, which likely contributed to 
caution on the part of IPO-ready companies. Late in the quarter, AI 
infrastructure firm CoreWeave held its IPO, although the company’s 
relatively lackadaisical results were not expected to spur additional market 
activity. Sweden-based Klarna filed for an IPO during the quarter, but the 
offering was put on hold following a wave of market volatility triggered by 
the US administration’s tariff announcements. Should Klarna move forward 
and perform well in a more stable environment, other companies — 
particularly well-positioned fintechs — could be encouraged to follow suit.
Hong Kong (SAR), China’s IPO market got off to a relatively strong start in 
2025, driven in part by the successful IPO of China-based bubble tea 
company Mixue. Given the challenges in the US, the HKSE appeared to 
benefit from Asia-based investors shifting their focus back to the Hong 
Kong (SAR), China market during the quarter.
Alternative energy and cleantech continue to see 
investment 
Alternative energy and cleantech remained attractive areas of 
investment in many regions of the world during Q1’25, with a range 
of companies attracting investments. In the US, alternative energy 
was the largest ticket, likely driven by recognition of the need for 
new energy sources to support ever-growing demand. During the 
quarter, nuclear energy-focused X Energy raised $700 million, and 
nuclear fission company Helion raised $425 million. 
In Europe and Asia, investments were more diverse, ranging from 
Germany-based real estate energy management company Reneo’s 
$624 million raise to Sweden-based long-term energy contracts 
firm Elvy’s $153 million raise, and from China-based smart EV 
maker Changan Kaicheng’s $274 million funding round to Australia-
based sustainable vertical farming company Stacked Farm’s 
$150 million raise. 
Trends to watch for in Q2’25
Heading into Q2’25, AI is expected to remain the 
primary driver of VC investment globally. 
Industry-focused AI solutions are likely to attract 
growing interest, alongside advanced robotics 
and enabling technologies such as LIDAR. Amid 
ongoing geopolitical tensions, sectors like 
defence-tech and cybersecurity are also 
projected to see increased VC activity.
However, VC investment may begin the quarter 
on a slower note as investors await greater clarity 
on the escalating global trade war and its 
potential economic ramifications. Global M&A 
activity could accelerate in Q2’25 and beyond, 
particularly in the AI space, as major tech 
companies seek to acquire promising startups 
before valuations rise further. The recently 
announced $32 billion deal for Google to acquire 
Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz — announced 
prior to the U.S. administration’s tariff 
announcements — may serve as a catalyst for 
increased M&A activity, particularly within the 
cybersecurity and broader tech sectors. In the 
face of continued IPO uncertainty, M&A remains 
a compelling alternative for companies seeking 
strategic exits.

“
We headed into Q1’25 with some 
cautious optimism around a 
renewed sense of business 
confidence, more investment and 
more exit activity. That optimism 
has now abated in the face of the 
uncertainty caused by various 
executive orders and the back 
and forth on tariffs and trade. 
With expectations for the 
recovery of the IPO market 
moving farther out again, we 
could see a shift in VC firms 
needing to reallocate investment 
priorities as some companies 
may need additional funding prior 
to a now more distant IPO.”

“
AI is going to drive a lot of diverse 
investment in the coming quarters. 
Large language models we have 
seen, but also small language 
models focused more on depth and 
relevance. Then there’s AI 
infrastructure — chips and other 
hardware, even the electricity 
needed to power AI. Plus, there’s 
the developments aimed at taking 
AI to the next level; right now, all 
the talk is about agentic thinking —
so taking that and looking at how to

VC investment in the US increases slightly led by OpenAI megadeal
VC investment in the US increased between Q4’24 and Q1’25; however, deal volume declined for the fourth consecutive quarter as some VC investors remained measured in the face of new 
uncertainties related to the actions of the new US administration. Deal speed slowed somewhat as investors took a more cautious approach to deal-making — particularly in areas like 
manufacturing and retail. 
AI space red-hot in the US
The AI space continued to account for many of the largest deals in the US during Q1’25, including a 
$40 billion raise by OpenAI, a $3.5 billion raise by Anthropic and a $3 billion raise by augmented reality 
firm Infinite Reality. A diversity of other startups also attracted sizeable funding rounds in the AI space, 
including AI for mining exploration company KoBold Metals ($537 million), AI development platform 
Lambda ($480 million), and humanoid robotics company Apptronik ($403 million). The US government 
showed firm commitment to development and support of the AI landscape during Q1’25 with the 
announcement of The Stargate Project — a $500 billion project aimed at building AI infrastructure — 
funded by investors including OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX.
Defense Tech sees big raises in US during Q1’25
Defense Tech continued to move up the charts in the eyes of VC investors in the US during Q1’25.
The quarter saw a number of large funding rounds in the space, including a $600 million raise by 
autonomous marine vessel company Saronic Technologies, a $240 million raise by autonomous drone 
company Shield AI, and a $250 million raise by anti-drone tech firm Epirus. Relatedly, there has also 
been growing interest in spacetech — a very complementary area of investment to defense tech — as 
VC investors recognize the importance of securing assets in the stratosphere and beyond.
Venture debt continuing to give startups opportunities to delay funding rounds
Venture debt continued to expand its role in the VC ecosystem in Q1’25, particularly given that as 
overall exit markets have contracted, VC firms have become more selective with equity. This, paired 
with the expansion of private credit in general — venture and otherwise — has provided some 
startups the opportunity to push back new funding rounds given the economic and geopolitical 
uncertainties affecting the market. While the cost of venture debt can be high, it can be particularly 
attractive for startups that are at or close to profitability and believe they have the economics to 
handle the debt load and interest.
Fintechs positioning for exit — the question is when?
The US is home to numerous fintechs that are at the front of the line from a maturity perspective, 
which has made them good candidates to lead an IPO charge. During the quarter, Sweden-based 
Klarna made big moves towards a US-based listing, including forging a partnership with US-based 
OnePay to offer buy now, pay later offerings to Walmart customers5 and filing its intent to IPO on the 
NYSE with the SEC.6 However, following tariff announcements that sparked market volatility, Klarna 
put its IPO on pause, opting to wait for a more stable environment.

VC investment in the US increases slightly led by OpenAI megadeal, cont’d.
Alternative energy stays on the radar of US VC investors
Despite shifting government priorities, alternative energy solutions 
remained quite high on the radar of VC investors in the US during Q1’25, 
in addition to technologies focused on providing more efficient energy 
production or more efficient energy consumption. During the quarter, 
advanced nuclear energy developer X Energy raised close to
$700 million, while nuclear fusion-focused Helion raised $425 million. 
Growing recognition of the need to meet rapidly rising energy demands 
will likely continue to spur investment in the alternative energy space 
heading into Q2’25.
Secondaries market continues to play positive role in 
providing liquidity
Given the extended drought in the IPO market, secondaries have 
continued to fill a void in the US in terms of providing liquidity to 
employees and early investors. The perception of secondaries has shifted 
significantly over the last 18 months; historically secondaries have been 
heavily discounted, while more recent secondary transactions have seen 
discounts narrow. This may reflect a number of trends, including 
companies choosing to stay private and using secondaries to provide 
employee and investor liquidity opportunities.
Trends to watch for in Q2’25
Heading into Q2’25, geopolitical tensions and 
economic concerns could keep some VC 
investors holding back given the amount of 
uncertainty in the market, in part because of 
the potential need to provide additional 
financing to existing portfolio companies as 
they navigate uncertain economic, supply 
chain and exit conditions. Investment in AI will 
likely continue to be the brightest light in the 
US, with investments expanding to include a 
broad variety of solutions from small language 
models, robotics, and agentic AI to AI-driven 
solutions for industries such as defense tech, 
health and biotech, and others.
M&A activity will be a key area to watch, as 
some companies may pursue strategic exits 
through acquisitions in response to ongoing 
market uncertainty. Attention will also remain 
fixed on the stock markets and whether 
volatility subsides enough to restore 
confidence in the IPO pipeline.

“
The energy transition is 
happening — there’s no turning 
back. While the pace may vary, 
investors are shifting from 
speculative R&D to proven 
business models in areas like 
nuclear and next-gen power.
At the same time, there’s renewed 
interest in traditional oil and gas, 
not as a step backward, but as a 
necessary part of a balanced, 
more efficient energy mix. The 
hype has cooled, but serious 
investors see this moment as a 
real opportunity.”

“
Liquidity continues to be a priority 
for many investors in VC firms. 
This has led to a rapid rise in 
secondary transactions to meet 
the demand. Venture capitalists 
are also pushing for smaller exits 
through acquisitions rather than 
waiting for larger, long-term 
returns in older portfolios. 
Additionally, there's growing 
interest in continuity vehicles that 
allow VC funds to reset the 
investment timeline. This gives a 
fund's investors the option for 
immediate liquidity or the chance 
to stay in the portfolio for potential 
future gains, alongside new 
investors. Multiple firms are either 
implementing this strategy or 
considering it right now.”

Markets don’t like uncertainty, 
and the US administration is 
causing significant uncertainty 
with its new tariff policies. That 
reality, coupled with the fact that 
no one wants to be the first to 
ring the bell in case they fall flat, 
has put a bit of a drag on the IPO 
window. Unfortunately, several 
companies that had bravely 
declared their path to IPO like 
Klarna and StubHub, have had to 
pull back on their plans recently 
due to the uncertainty. Having 
said that, if things settle, I am 
cautiously upbeat about IPOs 
going forward.”

Americas sees VC investment rise, but deal volume continues decline
Venture capital investment in the Americas climbed to a 13-quarter high in Q1 2025, driven by a wave of megadeals in the large language model (LLM) space — though the total was 
significantly skewed by OpenAI’s $40 billion raise.
Despite the surge in deal value, deal volume declined for the fourth straight quarter, highlighting 
continued investor caution. The number of deals softened notably, as the region faced a rockier-
than-expected start to the year. While optimism had grown following the US presidential election, 
renewed uncertainty around potential US tariffs prompted many VC investors to reassess and scale 
back their activity.
Uncertainties rattle stock markets, driving many US IPO exits farther out 
Heading into Q1’25, there was positivity that with the lessening of uncertainty in the wake of the US 
election, IPO exits would begin to pick up after the extended dry spell. However, a fresh wave of 
uncertainty and related stock market turbulence driven by the announcement of various tariffs by the 
new US administration caused many IPO ready startups to push their US IPO exit plans out another
6-12 months. During Q1’25, US-based AI infrastructure company CoreWeave was the only large tech 
company to brave the uncertainty to hold an IPO. After downsizing its IPO, CoreWeave raised
$1.5 billion at a $23 billion valuation, ending flat at the end of its first day of trading.7
VC investment in Canada hits multi-year low
Venture capital investment in Canada was notably subdued in Q1 2025, amid escalating concerns over 
a tariff war with the United States. Total VC investment reached just $917 million across 148 deals — 
levels not seen since early 2018.
The muted activity was also likely influenced by the upcoming federal election in April, which caused 
many VC firms and corporate investors to hold off on major funding decisions. Among the largest 
Canadian deals of the quarter were a $53 million raise by LemFi, a financial services platform for 
immigrants, and a $50 million round by Clutch, an online automotive buy-and-sell platform.
In response to the burgeoning trade war with the US, Q1’25 saw the Business Development Bank of 
Canada announce $500 million in capital for its Growth Venture Fund and $450 million for its Growth 
Equity Partners funds in order to support Canadian growth-stage tech companies having difficulties 
raising funding given the difficult market conditions.8
VC investment in Mexico dries up in Q1’25 as trade concerns drive uncertainty
VC investment in Mexico fell quarter-over-quarter as trade tensions with the US caused uncertainty to 
rise to levels not seen in recent memory. Some VC investors held back from making investments in 
Mexico — and Latin America more broadly — while corporates with nearshoring plans and companies 
looking to potentially expand operations to Mexico also hit pause amid concerns and uncertainties 
related to announced and pending US tariffs. At a sector level, fintech continued to be the focus of VC 
investment in Mexico; during Q1’25, credit and BNPL company Plata raised $160 million — earning it 
coveted unicorn status with a valuation of $1.5 billion.9 Proptech has also seen some growth in 
Mexico, particularly related to short-term and vacation rentals.

Americas sees VC investment rise, but deal volume continues decline, cont’d.
Canada not being left behind in AI space
While the US accounted for the vast majority of VC investment in 
AI — not only in the Americas, but globally — Canada has continued 
to grow its AI ecosystem and leadership in key areas, including 
AI-driven data analytics and AI enablement in areas like customer 
relations. In Q1’25, the Canadian government launched its $300 
million AI Compute Access Fund to provide affordable assess to 
computing power for the development of AI solutions by Canadian 
small and mid-sized companies.10
Government of Mexico focused on building for the future
During Q1’25, Mexico released Plan México, a six-year economic 
development plan focused on building Mexico’s economy in a number 
of strategic ways — from creating jobs in specialized manufacturing 
and promoting environmentally sustainable investments to producing 
more goods in Mexico and providing access to finance to more small 
and mid-sized businesses.11 Looking forward, it is expected that this 
plan could spur activity in a range of sectors, including infrastructure, 
clean energy, and pharma and biotech.

11 https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/plan-mexico-world-10th-largest-economy-sheinbaum/
Trends to watch for in Q2’25
Across the Americas, uncertainty will likely be a 
big theme heading into Q2’25 given the ongoing 
trade tensions between the US and other 
jurisdictions, including Canada and Mexico.
IPO activity across the Americas is expected to 
remain relatively subdued in Q2, as investors 
stay cautious and wait for greater clarity on the 
economic outlook, stock market performance, 
and the evolving tariff agenda.
In the US, AI will likely continue to attract the 
largest share of VC investment. In Canada, 
there could be some additional consolidation 
among smaller startups in an effort to achieve 
scale. AI and cleantech will likely continue to 
attract interest from investors in Canada, 
although given the uncertain market, funding 
will likely remain muted over the next quarter. In 
Mexico, the fintech market could see some 
consolidation as the largest companies succeed 
and others look to consolidate in order to better 
compete or to keep from falling by the wayside. 
During the quarter, Mexico could also see 
investments moving forward related to Plan 
Mexico, particularly in areas like infrastructure, 
energy, and biotech and pharma.

“
In early 2025, we’re seeing 
steady exit activity in Canada 
driven by consolidation, while 
VC investment remains cautious 
amid uncertainty around tariffs 
and the upcoming federal 
election. Despite this, Canada is 
doubling down on AI with major 
government funding for compute 
infrastructure, and we're seeing 
early signs of growth in clean 
tech, fusion energy, and deep 
tech. The overarching theme 
right now is uncertainty — but 
targeted investments in AI and 
sustainability show long-term 
optimism.”

“
We are living in a completely 
uncertain environment — 
possibly the most uncertain we’ve 
ever faced. And that’s affecting 
all business and economic 
spaces — not just VC. It’s difficult 
to define the potential economic 
impact because there’s no 
certainty yet. But even with the 
uncertainty, some sectors will 
continue to attract funding, 
including fintech and proptech. 
Sectors like clean energy, 
infrastructure, and pharma could 
also start to see more interest 
given the government’s new 
economic plan.”

European VC investment holds steady, but deal volume falls
VC investment in Europe remained flat in Q1 2025, holding at $18 billion, the same as in Q4 2024. However, deal volume declined significantly, with 1,883 deals recorded — down from 
2,314 the previous quarter. 
Despite the overall plateau in funding value, the number of megadeals increased, signaling a shift 
towards larger, later-stage investments. Q1 2025 saw five deals exceeding $500 million, up from three 
in Q4 2024. On a country level, the UK led European investment activity with $5.5 billion raised, 
followed by Germany at $2.2 billion and France at $1.7 billion.
Q1’25 deal volume drops to nine-year low amid geopolitical and economic 
uncertainty
Despite expectations that deal volume might begin to show a true rebound in Q1’25, the number 
of VC deals in Europe fell to a nine-year low amid a fresh wave of geopolitical and economic 
uncertainty driven in part by concerns related to the new US administration’s announcement of various 
tariffs regimes.
AI space remains super hot as VC investors focus on industry applications
During Q1’25, VC investors in Europe continued to show significant interest in AI, although deal sizes 
were relatively subdued compared to previous quarters — partly due to the absence of big raises by 
LLM-focused companies. Startups focused on industry applications of AI saw the strongest interest in 
Q1’25, with companies in the health and biotech (Neko Health — $260 million, Cera — $150 million) 
and enterprise communications (Synthesia — $180 million) spaces raising large rounds. 
The European Commission showed very strong commitment to the evolution of AI in Q1’25 with the 
announcement of its $206 billion InvestAI program,12 including significant funding for the development 
of gigafactories. In Q1’25, France also announced $112 billion in committed AI investments, including 
€20 billion from Canada-based investment firm Brookfield for AI-focused projects in the country.13
Health and biotech sector attracts numerous $100 million+ VC deals 
VC investment in the health and biotech sector was robust in Q1’25, with numerous $100 million+ 
funding rounds across the region, including raises by UK-based Verdiva Bio ($410 million) and Cera 
($150 million); Sweden-based Neko Health ($260 million); Switzerland-based Windward Bio
($200 million), Numab ($194 million), CeQur Simplicity ($120 million), and Ireland-based Fire1 
($120 million). The diversity of investments across both geographies and focus areas (e.g. obesity 
therapeutics, oncology treatments, insulin delivery wearables, digital healthcare solutions, medical 
scanning) highlights the continued strength of investor interest in all areas of health and biotech, from 
health management and monitoring to medical devices, digital health, and disease prevention. 
VC investment in the UK falls quarter-over-quarter
VC investment in the UK fell between Q4’24 and Q1’25 as VC investors continued to show a 
preference for proven startups given the uncertain market conditions and the ongoing lack of exits. 
While the health and biotech sector continued to attract robust investment during Q1’24 — led by a
$410 million raise by Verdiva Bio — some UK-based biotech companies requiring patient capital 
struggled to attract funding as VC investors focused on startups with quicker paths to profitability.
M&A activity started to pick up in the UK during Q1’25, although the uptick has not yet translated into 
deal value given slow deal speeds and the enhanced focus on due diligence. During the quarter, PE 
firms were much more active in the M&A market, both due to improving interest rates and the desire to 
make investments within a reasonable timeframe or risk taking themselves out of existence.

European VC investment holds steady, but deal volume falls, cont’d.
Germany sees VC investment rise
Despite an increase in VC funding in Q1’25, the total number of VC 
deals in Germany was incredibly low compared to historical norms, with 
many completed deals coming as follow-on investments from existing 
investors. Seed and pre-seed deals were particularly soft, driven in part 
by a pullback from VCs looking to derisk their investments. The federal 
election in February likely also had a subduing effect on deal activity as 
investors waited to assess the impact of shifting government priorities on 
the VC ecosystem.
Despite uncertainties, fintech, AI and deeptech, and defense remained 
quite attractive to VC investors in Germany. Real estate decarbonization 
firm Reneo raised the largest funding round in Germany during the 
quarter ($624 million), followed distantly by medical education company 
Amboss ($257 million). During Q1’25, a growing number of late-stage 
companies in Germany also focused on IPO readiness programs, with 
the hope of exit opportunities towards the end of 2025 and into 2026.
Nordic region sees dip in VC funding in Q1’25
VC investment in the Nordic region fell quarter-over-quarter, although 
investors continued to show interest in areas like healthtech and 
cleantech. During the quarter, Sweden-based preventative health 
technology company Neko Health raised $260 million, sustainable 
energy services company Elvy raised $153 million, and Finland-based 
low carbon hydrogen producer Hycamite raised $45.8 million. Current 
geopolitical uncertainty, tariffs and trade tensions may prolong the 
stagnate state of the Nordic VC investment further down 2025.
VC investment in Ireland rises significantly on back of 
megadeals
Ireland experienced it’s strongest quarter of VC investment in several 
years in Q1’25, driven primarily by large megadeals, including a
$125 million raise by AI-powered productivity software company 
Tines, a $120 million raise by medical device company Fire1, and a 
$120 million raise by ocean data services company Xocean. Fintech 
and medtech sectors in Ireland continue to attract significant interest 
from VC investors given their robust innovation ecosystems and 
strong talent base, with AI solutions also receiving significant 
investment over the quarter. While positive coming into 2025, the 
sentiment of VC investors in Ireland was one of caution in the latter 
half of Q1’25 amid rising geopolitical uncertainties. The growing 
uncertainty could impact VC investment heading into 2025.
Global | US | Americas  Europe Asia
Trends to watch for in Q2’25
Heading into Q2’25, deal volume will likely 
remain subdued as investors in Europe 
remain very cautious amid trade tensions 
with the US. The implications associated 
with any US tariffs could be significant; 
both investors and startups are expected 
to be quite focused on assessing potential 
impacts on both general operations and 
potential cross-border expansion plans. 
Despite these uncertainties, areas like AI, 
defense tech, and cleantech will likely 
continue to attract significant megadeals 
in Europe.

“
While we’re still seeing funds being 
deployed and funds being raised, 
deal volume continues to be lower 
than expected. This tells us a few 
things. There’s clearly huge 
confidence in certain sectors.
AI, cleantech, fintech — they’re all 
still seeing megadeals. But what 
we’re not seeing is that higher 
cadence of Series A and Series B 
rounds come back. And maybe 
that’s a trend here to stay with 
investors writing bigger and longer 
lifecycle cheques — giving 3 years 
of runway rather than 18 months to 
hit certain milestones.”

“
We’re noticing that a lot of VC 
investors right now are looking for 
companies that are going to be 
relatively quick to profitability at 
the moment. In the UK, this has 
made it challenging for startups in 
IP-rich areas like biotech to attract 
sufficient funding. These kinds of 
companies require patient capital, 
which is not very favorable at the 
moment. It feels like a real shame 
given the innovative companies 
we have here in the UK and  
these IP-rich sectors are not 
getting the support that they 
might need. ”

“
Irish VC fundraising was very 
strong in Q1’25 led by significant 
fundraises by Tines, XOcean and 
Fire1. The lower deal count quarter 
on quarter is reflective of a more 
cautious sentiment given broader 
geopolitical uncertainty since the 
turn of the year. Notwithstanding 
these challenges, VC investment in 
Ireland mirrored international trends 
with robust interest in the AI, big 
data and medtech sectors.”

The big investments in Germany 
right now are coming later-stage 
fintechs, and from AI and 
deeptech companies. We’re also 
seeing interest in hardware 
startups focused on areas like 
chip development and some 
investment in drones and other 
defense-related startups. The 
focus on defense tech is a major 
change here in Germany — 
historically investors have been 
very shy about investing in the 
space. That’s definitely changing.”

“
Q1’25 investment trends are 
consistent with that of previous 
2024 quarters, with a gradual 
increase both in number and 
volume of deals. Over 60% of the 
deals are early stage (pre-seed to 
Round A), while later stage deals 
included five rounds of $100M or 
more. 20 M&A deals took place in 
Q1, with seven deals of $100M or 
more. We see a positive sentiment 
by leading foreign VCs, which 
established or strengthened their 
presence in Israel, banking on the 
current decline in companies’ 
valuations. We expect the positive 
trend to continue into Q2 2025, with 
certain reservations pertaining to 
unforeseen circumstances due to 
current global economic instability.”

Asia sees VC activity decline amid regional headwinds
Both venture capital investment and deal volume declined in Asia during Q1 2025, with the region raising just $12.9 billion across 2,149 deals — reflecting continued softness in the market. 
The downturn was largely driven by persistent challenges in China, including economic uncertainty and ongoing real estate sector issues, as well as heightened investor caution in India, 
amid broader geopolitical tensions. Singapore was the lone bright spot, bucking the regional trend thanks to a $1.2 billion raise by data center company DayOne, which significantly 
boosted the country’s quarterly totals.
AI space sees a lot of excitement in Asia during Q1’25, particularly in China
The AI space in Asia attracted a significant amount of attention in Q1’25, driven by the launch of China-based 
DeepSeek’s R1 model. This was seen as a major win for China’s AI sector, given the expectation that access 
to DeepSeek’s open source model will help a lot of AI application companies further advance their own 
models and AI-driven solutions. During the quarter, two Chinese tech giants also launched major AI 
offerings — including Tencent, which launched the T1 reasoning model,14 and Alibaba, which released the 
Qwen 2.5 artificial intelligence model. This feverish level of activity highlights the highly competitive nature of 
the space and the quest for dominant market position.15
IPO market in Hong Kong (SAR), China shows strength in Q1’25
The IPO market and stock exchanges in Hong Kong (SAR), China got off to a strong start in Q1’25. 
The HKSE hosted a number of IPOs, including Mixue — China’s largest bubble tea company — which 
saw shares rise 47 percent in first day trading.16 Given the degrading performance of the US stock 
exchanges over the quarter, there was a notable shift of Asia-based investors back to the HKSE, and 
growing interest from investors from Korea and Japan. The rise in transaction volume was particularly 
positive, prompting a sense of positivity heading into Q2’25. During Q1’25, Hong Kong also enhanced its
efforts to market the HKSE as a place for IPO fundraising within other jurisdictions, including Saudi 
Arabia and Japan.
Quiet quarter of VC investment in China amid absence of largest deals
VC investment in China was muted in Q1’25, both as a result of a natural slowdown in deal activity 
related to Chinese New Year, and because of ongoing economic challenges. Following on trends seen
 
in recent quarters, much of the VC investment in China during Q1’25 occurred in areas considered to be 
major government priorities, including hard technologies, new energy, electric vehicles, and AI. 
Cleantech company SE Environmental raised the largest deal in China during the quarter ($688 million) 
followed by new energy vehicle company Changan Kaicheng ($274 million), AI-powered autonomous 
van company Neolix Technologies ($137 million), electronic design automation company Univista 
($137 million), and chip manufacturer InventChip Technology ($136 million). 
VC investors in China also continued to show interest in earlier-stage companies, evidenced by the 
popularity of pre-Series A deals during the quarter. Tis likely reflects a desire to invest in companies 
early in order to leverage the growth when their technologies are ready to be monetized in the market. 
VC investment dips slightly in India as investors taking a wait-and-see approach to 
uncertainty
India saw VC investment drop slightly in Q1’25 as investors held back from making major investments 
given the rapidly evolving geopolitical situation. Capital markets also took a beating in India during the 
quarter amid concerns of overpricing. While markets recovered somewhat in the second half of Q1’25, 
the general trajectory was lower than initially expected in Q4’24. 
E-commerce and quick commerce big winners in India in Q1’25
VC investors in India remained highly focused on consumer offerings in Q1’25, with areas such as
e-commerce and quick commerce attracting the most significant attention; during the quarter social
e-commerce platform Meesho raised $550 million. Payments and lending also continued to be a key
sector of investment in India, with Tonetag — a startup focused on voice-powered commerce and
payments — raising $78 million.

Asia sees VC activity decline amid regional headwinds, cont’d.
Japan’s VC market holds relatively steady amid regional 
declines
VC investment in Japan remained relatively strong in Q1 2025, reaching 
$902 million across 290 deals, compared to $1.1 billion on 318 deals in Q4 
2024. In the context of broader declines across Asia, Japan’s performance 
was notably stable. That said, the market faced headwinds, including 
ongoing softness in IPO activity, which limited perceived exit opportunities 
and dampened expectations for VC fund performance.  Additionally, a 
growing number of startups struggled to secure follow-on funding during 
the quarter — a trend that may lead to increased sales or dissolutions 
heading into Q2 2025.
Government support for spacetech development in Japan
In Japan, AI, DeepTech and SpaceTech attracted the most attention from 
VC investors in Q1’25, in addition to drug discovery, ESG-related solutions, 
and SaaS IT solutions. Spacetech was particularly notable given the $51 
million raise by microsatellite company ArkEdge Space and the $44 million 
raise by space transportation and satellite development company 
Interstellar Technologies. Government support for the space satellite 
sector, the ready availability of rocket launch locations in the country, and 
the expectation that Japan will increase its space-related defense budget 
will likely keep SpaceTech a hot area of innovation and investment heading 
into Q2’25.
Biotech seeing increasing interest in China as investors 
eye licensing-out opportunities
Historically, VC investors in China have been hesitant about investing 
in biotech because of the long timeframe required for returns. This 
trend shifted in Q1’25, in part because of the growth in licensing-out 
trends, which have led to developments in different regions and 
attracted fresh cash flows to China-based biotechs. During the quarter, 
VC investors showed increasing interest in biotechs with the potential 
to license out their pipelines. 
Global | US | Americas | Europe Asia
Trends to watch for in Q2’25
Heading into Q2’25, VC investment in Asia is 
expected to remain subdued, particularly 
giving geopolitical uncertainties. If China’s 
central government moves to support the 
development of the private sector, it could 
spark improved confidence among VC 
investors and potentially drive an uptick in 
investment in China. VC investment in India 
could remain somewhat soft in Q2’25, 
although the long-term outlook remains 
positive given the country’s strong macros. 
In Japan, corporate investment will be one 
area to watch in Q2’25, both in terms of 
direct VC investment and M&A activity.

“
The most important thing in India 
right now is that the macros are 
intact. Nothing fundamentally has 
changed. The money has started 
coming back to India. There are 
certain large IPOs of startups that 
have been announced, which 
should hit the market over the 
next one or two quarters. I think 
we are back in business — and 
what we’re seeing now is really 
just a minor impediment — a 
speedbump.”

“
Everything that has happened in 
the AI space here in China this 
quarter — in terms of the launch 
of DeepSeek, Tencent, and 
Alibaba’s different AI models — 
gives me a lot of confidence in 
this sector and the investment 
possibilities that will occur over 
time. These advancements will 
not only spur the development of 
other AI offerings, but the more 
players that there are, the more 
healthy competition there will be 
in the market.”

“
Venture capital flows to Australian 
startups remained steady during 
the first quarter of the year. Global 
economic uncertainty may tamper 
some of the cautious optimism we 
saw at the start of 2025, but we 
are still seeing investor interest in 
AI and greentech innovation as 
well as an uptick of activity in 
sectors such as defence and 
space.”

About the report
Methodology
KPMG uses PitchBook as the provider of venture data for the Venture Pulse report 
Please note that the MESA and Africa regions are NOT broken out in this report. Accordingly, if you add up the Americas, 
Asia-Pacific and Europe regional totals, they will not match the global total, as the global total considers those other regions. 
Those specific regions were not highlighted in this report due to a paucity of datasets and verifiable trends.
In addition, particularly within the European region, the Venture Pulse does not contain any transactions that are tracked as 
private equity growth by PitchBook. As such rounds are often conflated with late-stage venture capital in media coverage, there 
can be confusion regarding specific rounds of financing. The key difference is that PitchBook defines a PE growth round as a 
financial investment occurring when a PE investor acquires a minority stake in a privately held corporation. Thus, if the investor is 
classified as PE by PitchBook, and it is the sole participant in the recipient company’s financing, then such a round will usually be 
classified as PE growth, and not included in the Venture Pulse datasets. However, as of the Q4 2022 edition, a new stage for 
venture that was invented by PitchBook to account for growth at late-stage VC will be included, defined as venture growth. That 
same edition saw some minor updates to the wording of the methodology on this page.
Also, if a company is tagged with any PitchBook vertical, excepting manufacturing and infrastructure, it is kept. Otherwise, the 
following industries are excluded from growth equity financing calculations: buildings and property, thrifts and mortgage finance, 
real estate investment trusts, and oil & gas equipment, utilities, exploration, production and refining. Lastly, the company in 
question must not have had an M&A event, buyout, or IPO completed prior to the round in question.
Fundraising
PitchBook defines VC funds as pools of capital raised for the purpose of investing in the equity of startup companies. In 
addition to funds raised by traditional VC firms, PitchBook also includes funds raised by any institution with the primary 
intent stated above. Funds identifying as growthstage vehicles are classified as PE funds and are not included in this 
report. A fund’s location is determined by the country in which the fund’s investment team is based; if that information is 
not explicitly known, the HQ country of the fund’s general partner is used. Only funds based in the United States that have 
held their final close are included in the fundraising numbers. The entirety of a fund’s committed capital is attributed to the 
year of the final close of the fund. Interim close amounts are not recorded in the year of the interim close.
Deals
PitchBook includes equity investments into startup companies from an outside source. Investment does not necessarily 
have to be taken from an institutional investor. This can include investment from individual angel investors, angel groups, 
seed funds, VC firms, corporate venture firms, corporate investors, and institutions, among others. Investments received 
as part of an accelerator program are not included; however, if the accelerator continues to invest in follow-on rounds, 
those further financings are included. All financings are of companies headquartered in the US, with any reference to 
“ecosystem” defined as the combined statistical area (CSA). PitchBook includes deals that include partial debt and equity.
Pre-seed/seed: The pre-seed stage encompasses a collection of emergent startups receiving the first check from at least 
one institutional investor to fuel their development growth. For global startups, we reclassify angel deals depending on 
institutional investors’ prior deal participation. Deals that have been tagged as “angel” due to the company’s investor base
consisting solely of individual investors will now be recategorized into the early-stage or late-stage VC deal category 
based on stage methodologies in place. For startups headquartered in the US and Europe, we define pre-seed as a 
round of financing for a company founded less than two years ago that has not yet received institutional investor 
support. This update was made in the Q4 2023 edition of Venture Pulse and all subsequent editions.
•
Early-stage: Rounds are generally classified as Series A or B (which we typically aggregate together as early-stage) 
either by the series of stock issued in the financing or, if that information is unavailable, by a series of factors 
including: the age of the company, prior financing history, company status, participating investors, and more. 
•
Late-stage: Rounds are generally classified as Series C or D or later (which we typically aggregate together as 
late-stage) either by the series of stock issued in the financing or, if that information is unavailable, by a series of 
factors including: the age of the company, prior financing history, company status, participating investors, and more. 
•
Growth: Financings tagged as Series E or later or deals involving companies that are at least seven years old and 
have raised at least six VC rounds will be included in this category, as of the Q4 2022 edition of Venture Pulse 
released in January 2023.
•
Corporate: Corporate rounds of funding for currently venture-backed startups that meet the criteria for other 
PitchBook venture financings are included in the Venture Pulse as of March 2019.
•
Corporate venture capital: Financings classified as corporate venture capital include rounds that saw both firms 
investing via established CVC arms or corporations making equity investments off balance sheets or whatever other 
non-CVC method is employed.
Exits
PitchBook includes the first majority liquidity event for holders of equity securities of venture-backed companies. This 
includes events where there is a public market for the shares (IPO) or the acquisition of majority of the equity by another 
entity (corporate or financial acquisition). This does not include secondary sales, further sales after the initial liquidity 
event, or bankruptcies. M&A value is based on reported or disclosed figures, with no estimation used to assess the value 
of transactions for which the actual deal size is unknown. IPO value is based on the premoney valuation of the company 
at its IPO price. One slight methodology update is the categorical change from “IPO” to “public listings” to accommodate 
the different ways we track VC-backed companies’ transitions to the public markets. To give readers a fuller picture of 
the companies that go public, this updated grouping includes IPOs, direct listings, and reverse mergers via special 
purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). 
In the edition of the KPMG Venture Pulse covering Q1 2019 and all ensuing, PitchBook’s methodology regarding aggregate 
exit values changed. Instead of utilizing the size of an IPO as the exit value, the prevaluation of an IPO, based upon 
ordinary shares outstanding, was utilized. This has led to a significant change in aggregate exit values in all subsequent 
editions yet is more reflective of how the industry views the true size of an exit via public markets. In the edition of the 
KPMG Venture Pulse covering Q1 2021 and all ensuing, the IPO exit type was updated to include all types of public listings, 
including SPACs and other reverse mergers. In January 2025, a new extrapolation for M&A exit values was also applied.

KPMG Private Enterprise quarterly global report on venture capital trends
Share
VC investment globally increased between Q4’24 and Q1’25, driven in part by a large number of $1 billion+ megadeals, including a standout investment of $40 billion in OpenAI. Other big deals included Anthropic — $4.5 billion (two closings), Infinite Reality — $3 billion, Binance — $2 billion, Groq — $1.5 billion, DayOne — $1.2 billion, and X — $1 billion.

VC investment in the Americas surged in Q1 2025, driven by a series of megadeals, while Europe saw more muted growth and Asia experienced another quarterly decline, reaching record low investment levels. Deal volume dropped across all regions, as investors remained cautious amid macroeconomic uncertainty.
The US retained its position as the top destination for VC funding, bolstered by several high-profile raises, including OpenAI’s $40 billion raise, Anthropic’s $4.5 billion raise (two closings), and Infinite Reality’s $3 billion raise in the augmented reality space. Europe ranked second in total VC investment, led by Binance’s $2 billion raise — the region’s largest of the quarter — followed by German proptech firm Reneo, which secured $624 million. Asia’s VC market remained soft, with just three deals exceeding $500 million. Singapore-based datacentre firm DayOne led with a $1.2 billion raise, followed by China’s cleantech company SE Environmental ($688 million) and India-based e-commerce platform Meesho ($550 million).
AI plays continued to dominate the VC market in Q1’25. While the largest deals in the AI sector occurred in the US led, by OpenAI, Anthropic and Infinite Reality, other regions also saw robust AI investments. In Europe, AI-enabled industry solutions companies raised a number of $100 million funding rounds, including Sweden-based preventative healthtech company Neko Health ($260 million) and UK-based AI-powered video communications company Synthesia ($180 million). Asia also saw a number of significant AI-focused raises, including China-based Neolix Technologies ($137 million) and Univista ($137 million), Australia-based Harrison.ai ($111 million), Hong Kong (SAR) and Boston-based InSilico Medicine ($100 million), and India-based Spotdraft ($54 million).
Looking at the AI space more broadly, the launch of China-based DeepSeek’s R1 AI model sent ripples across the globe in Q1’25. DeepSeek’s launch was followed closely by new AI models by Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba. The launch of the three models so close together — all purporting to be more energy efficient than others built to date — highlights the intense competition globally and regionally for market dominance in the large language model (LLM) space.
As competition heated up in the AI space worldwide, a number of governments made substantive moves in order to promote, encourage, and accelerate AI development. During the quarter, the US announced The Stargate Project, which aims to spend $500 billion on developing next gen AI infrastructure in the US.1
This was followed by the European Commission’s announcement of its InvestAI program2— a plan to drive $206 billion into AI innovation, including the development of gigafactories — and France’s announcement of $112 billion in AI investment commitments.3During the quarter, China also announced a $138 billion national venture capital guidance fund to invest in a range of priority sectors, including AI and quantum computing.4
Interest in defense tech continued to grow in Q1’25, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions. The US saw the largest defense tech deals during the quarter, including a $600 million raise by Saronic Technologies, a $240 million raise by ShieldAI, and a $250 million raise by Epirus. Spacetech also continued to grow on the radar of investors. Japan in particular saw several deals during the quarter, including raises by ArkEdge Space ($51 million) and Interstellar Technologies ($45 million).

Heading into Q2’25, AI is expected to remain the primary driver of VC investment globally. Industry-focused AI solutions are likely to attract growing interest, alongside advanced robotics and enabling technologies such as LIDAR. Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, sectors like defence-tech and cybersecurity are also projected to see increased VC activity.
However, VC investment may begin the quarter on a slower note as investors await greater clarity on the escalating global trade war and its potential economic ramifications. Global M&A activity could accelerate in Q2’25 and beyond, particularly in the AI space, as major tech companies seek to acquire promising startups before valuations rise further. The recently announced $32 billion deal for Google to acquire Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz — announced prior to the U.S. administration’s tariff announcements — may serve as a catalyst for increased M&A activity, particularly within the cybersecurity and broader tech sectors. In the face of continued IPO uncertainty, M&A remains a compelling alternative for companies seeking strategic exits.

#Q1VC
Welcome message
Welcome to the Q1’25 edition of KPMG Private Enterprise’s Venture 
Pulse — a quarterly report highlighting the major trends, challenges, 
and opportunities facing the venture capital market globally and in key 
jurisdictions around the world.
Against a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and renewed concerns 
over tariffs and trade tensions, global VC investment rose from
$118 billion in Q4’24 to $126 billion in Q1’25, fueled by a wave of 
megadeals — including eight $1 billion+ transactions and a standout 
$40 billion raise by OpenAI.
Despite the uptick in investment value, deal volume declined quarter-
over-quarter as many VC investors paused to evaluate whether 
market shifts were temporary and to preserve capital in light of 
ongoing IPO exit delays. Deal-making also slowed as firms adapted to 
evolving investment considerations.
The Americas attracted the largest share of VC investment globally 
during the quarter. The US accounted for the bulk of this investment, 
including a $40 billion standout deal by OpenAI, a $4.5 billion raise by 
Anthropic (two closings) and a $3 billion raise by Infinite Reality. VC 
investment in Europe remained flat quarter-over-quarter at $18 billion, 
led by a massive $2 billion deal by cryptocurrency exchange Binance, 
followed by Germany-based energy management proptech Reneo 
($624 million) and UK-based AI drug discovery firm Isomorphic Labs 
($600 million).  VC investment in Asia fell from $18.9 billion in Q4’24 to 
a record low $12.9 billion in Q1’25. Singapore-based data center firm 
DayOne raised the largest VC deal ($1.2 billion) of the quarter 
followed by Chinese cleantech SE Environmental ($688 million) and 
India-based e-commerce company Meesho ($550 million). 
AI remained the hottest ticket globally. In addition to large raises by 
LLM-focused companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, companies 
focused on AI applications (e.g. augmented reality, autonomous
Unless otherwise noted, all currencies reflected throughout this document are in US dollars.

vehicles, robotics) and industry solutions — such as AI for mining tech 
company Kobold Metals ($537 million) and AI preventative health 
company Cera ($150 million)—also saw significant investments. 
Defense Tech and spacetech also continued to gain traction with VC 
investors.
While there had been optimism that Q1’25 could mark a rebound in IPO 
activity in the US, lingering market uncertainties led many startups to 
delay their public debut plans. US-based AI infrastructure firm 
CoreWeave went public late in the quarter, though its relatively muted 
performance — and unique business model—meant it wasn’t seen as a 
reliable indicator for broader IPO sentiment. Sweden-based fintech 
Klarna had initially signaled plans for a Q1 IPO but ultimately postponed 
the offering. Its performance, should the IPO proceed in Q2, will be 
closely watched as a potential bellwether for other late-stage tech 
companies considering the public markets. 
The current levels of geopolitical uncertainty will likely continue to affect 
the VC market heading into Q2’25, although areas like AI, defense tech, 
cybersecurity, and alternative energy will likely remain resilient.
In this quarter’s edition of Venture Pulse, we examine these and a 
number of other global and regional trends, including:
•
The increasing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties
•
The expanding diversity of AI solutions attracting investments
•
The growing attention being given to defense tech and spacetech
•
The increasing involvement of governments in driving AI investments
We hope you find this edition of Venture Pulse insightful. If you would 
like to discuss any of the results in more detail, please contact a KPMG 
adviser in your area.

Global VC investment falters amid fresh wave of uncertainty 
VC investment globally increased between Q4’24 and Q1’25, driven in part by a large number of $1 billion+ megadeals, including a standout investment of $40 billion in OpenAI. 
Other big deals included Anthropic — $4.5 billion (two closings), Infinite Reality — $3 billion, Binance — $2 billion, Groq — $1.5 billion, DayOne — $1.2 billion and X — $1 billion. 
US attracts over two-thirds of VC funding globally in Q1’25
VC investment in the Americas surged in Q1 2025, driven by a series of megadeals, while Europe 
saw more muted growth and Asia experienced another quarterly decline, reaching record low 
investment levels. Deal volume dropped across all regions, as investors remained cautious amid 
macroeconomic uncertainty.  
The US retained its position as the top destination for VC funding, bolstered by several high-profile 
raises, including OpenAI’s $40 billion raise, Anthropic’s $4.5 billion raise (two closings), and Infinite 
Reality’s $3 billion raise in the augmented reality space. Europe ranked second in total VC 
investment, led by Binance’s $2 billion raise — the region’s largest of the quarter — followed by 
German proptech firm Reneo, which secured $624 million. Asia’s VC market remained soft, with just 
three deals exceeding$500 million. Singapore-based datacentre firm DayOne led with a $1.2 billion 
raise, followed by China’s cleantech company SE Environmental ($688 million) and India-based 
e-commerce platform Meesho ($550 million).
Hot AI space attracting diversity of deals across jurisdictions
AI plays continued to dominate the VC market in Q1’25. While the largest deals in the AI sector 
occurred in the US led, by OpenAI, Anthropic and Infinite Reality, other regions also saw robust AI 
investments. In Europe, AI-enabled industry solutions companies raised a number of $100 million 
funding rounds, including Sweden-based preventative healthtech company Neko Health ($260 million) 
and UK-based AI-powered video communications company Synthesia ($180 million). Asia also saw a 
number of significant AI-focused raises, including China-based Neolix Technologies ($137 million) and 
Univista ($137 million), Australia-based Harrison.ai ($111 million), Hong Kong (SAR) and Boston-
based InSilico Medicine ($100 million), and India-based Spotdraft ($54 million).

4 https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-set-up-national-venture-capital-guidance-fund-state-planner-says-2025-03-06/
Looking at the AI space more broadly, the launch of China-based DeepSeek’s R1 AI model sent 
ripples across the globe in Q1’25. DeepSeek’s launch was followed closely by new AI models by 
Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba. The launch of the three models so close together — all 
purporting to be more energy efficient than others built to date — highlights the intense competition 
globally and regionally for market dominance in the large language model (LLM) space.
Geopolitical uncertainties and tensions driving VC investment into defense tech 
and spacetech
As competition heated up in the AI space worldwide, a number of governments made substantive 
moves in order to promote, encourage, and accelerate AI development. During the quarter, the US 
announced The Stargate Project, which aims to spend $500 billion on developing next-gen AI 
infrastructure in the US.1 This was followed by the European Commission’s announcement of its 
InvestAI program2  — a plan to drive $206 billion into AI innovation, including the development of 
gigafactories — and France’s announcement of $112 billion in AI investment commitments.3 During the 
quarter, China also announced a $138 billion national venture capital guidance fund to invest in a 
range of priority sectors, including AI and quantum computing.4
Alternative energy continues to attract interest globally
Interest in defense tech continued to grow in Q1’25, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions. The US 
saw the largest defense tech deals during the quarter, including a $600 million raise by Saronic 
Technologies, a $240 million raise by ShieldAI, and a $250 million raise by Epirus. Spacetech also 
continued to grow on the radar of investors. Japan in particular saw several deals during the quarter, 
including raises by ArkEdge Space ($51 million) and Interstellar Technologies ($45 million).

Global VC investment falters amid fresh wave of uncertainty, cont’d.
IPO market in US sees another setback amid new 
geopolitical uncertainties; HKSE sees some recovery
The hopeful optimism that characterized thoughts on the IPO market 
globally at the end of Q4’24 did not materialize in Q1’25. Concerns about 
tariffs and trade wars rose to the forefront of concerns, causing challenges 
across a number of stock markets globally, which likely contributed to 
caution on the part of IPO-ready companies. Late in the quarter, AI 
infrastructure firm CoreWeave held its IPO, although the company’s 
relatively lackadaisical results were not expected to spur additional market 
activity. Sweden-based Klarna filed for an IPO during the quarter, but the 
offering was put on hold following a wave of market volatility triggered by 
the US administration’s tariff announcements. Should Klarna move forward 
and perform well in a more stable environment, other companies — 
particularly well-positioned fintechs — could be encouraged to follow suit.
Hong Kong (SAR), China’s IPO market got off to a relatively strong start in 
2025, driven in part by the successful IPO of China-based bubble tea 
company Mixue. Given the challenges in the US, the HKSE appeared to 
benefit from Asia-based investors shifting their focus back to the Hong 
Kong (SAR), China market during the quarter.
Alternative energy and cleantech continue to see 
investment 
Alternative energy and cleantech remained attractive areas of 
investment in many regions of the world during Q1’25, with a range 
of companies attracting investments. In the US, alternative energy 
was the largest ticket, likely driven by recognition of the need for 
new energy sources to support ever-growing demand. During the 
quarter, nuclear energy-focused X Energy raised $700 million, and 
nuclear fission company Helion raised $425 million. 
In Europe and Asia, investments were more diverse, ranging from 
Germany-based real estate energy management company Reneo’s 
$624 million raise to Sweden-based long-term energy contracts 
firm Elvy’s $153 million raise, and from China-based smart EV 
maker Changan Kaicheng’s $274 million funding round to Australia-
based sustainable vertical farming company Stacked Farm’s 
$150 million raise. 
Trends to watch for in Q2’25
Heading into Q2’25, AI is expected to remain the 
primary driver of VC investment globally. 
Industry-focused AI solutions are likely to attract 
growing interest, alongside advanced robotics 
and enabling technologies such as LIDAR. Amid 
ongoing geopolitical tensions, sectors like 
defence-tech and cybersecurity are also 
projected to see increased VC activity.
However, VC investment may begin the quarter 
on a slower note as investors await greater clarity 
on the escalating global trade war and its 
potential economic ramifications. Global M&A 
activity could accelerate in Q2’25 and beyond, 
particularly in the AI space, as major tech 
companies seek to acquire promising startups 
before valuations rise further. The recently 
announced $32 billion deal for Google to acquire 
Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz — announced 
prior to the U.S. administration’s tariff 
announcements — may serve as a catalyst for 
increased M&A activity, particularly within the 
cybersecurity and broader tech sectors. In the 
face of continued IPO uncertainty, M&A remains 
a compelling alternative for companies seeking 
strategic exits.

“
We headed into Q1’25 with some 
cautious optimism around a 
renewed sense of business 
confidence, more investment and 
more exit activity. That optimism 
has now abated in the face of the 
uncertainty caused by various 
executive orders and the back 
and forth on tariffs and trade. 
With expectations for the 
recovery of the IPO market 
moving farther out again, we 
could see a shift in VC firms 
needing to reallocate investment 
priorities as some companies 
may need additional funding prior 
to a now more distant IPO.”

“
AI is going to drive a lot of diverse 
investment in the coming quarters. 
Large language models we have 
seen, but also small language 
models focused more on depth and 
relevance. Then there’s AI 
infrastructure — chips and other 
hardware, even the electricity 
needed to power AI. Plus, there’s 
the developments aimed at taking 
AI to the next level; right now, all 
the talk is about agentic thinking —
so taking that and looking at how to 
translate it into the real world, into 
robotics, into manufacturing.”

VC investment in the US increases slightly led by OpenAI megadeal
VC investment in the US increased between Q4’24 and Q1’25; however, deal volume declined for the fourth consecutive quarter as some VC investors remained measured in the face of new 
uncertainties related to the actions of the new US administration. Deal speed slowed somewhat as investors took a more cautious approach to deal-making — particularly in areas like 
manufacturing and retail. 
AI space red-hot in the US
The AI space continued to account for many of the largest deals in the US during Q1’25, including a 
$40 billion raise by OpenAI, a $3.5 billion raise by Anthropic and a $3 billion raise by augmented reality 
firm Infinite Reality. A diversity of other startups also attracted sizeable funding rounds in the AI space, 
including AI for mining exploration company KoBold Metals ($537 million), AI development platform 
Lambda ($480 million), and humanoid robotics company Apptronik ($403 million). The US government 
showed firm commitment to development and support of the AI landscape during Q1’25 with the 
announcement of The Stargate Project — a $500 billion project aimed at building AI infrastructure — 
funded by investors including OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX.
Defense Tech sees big raises in US during Q1’25
Defense Tech continued to move up the charts in the eyes of VC investors in the US during Q1’25.
The quarter saw a number of large funding rounds in the space, including a $600 million raise by 
autonomous marine vessel company Saronic Technologies, a $240 million raise by autonomous drone 
company Shield AI, and a $250 million raise by anti-drone tech firm Epirus. Relatedly, there has also 
been growing interest in spacetech — a very complementary area of investment to defense tech — as 
VC investors recognize the importance of securing assets in the stratosphere and beyond.
Venture debt continuing to give startups opportunities to delay funding rounds
Venture debt continued to expand its role in the VC ecosystem in Q1’25, particularly given that as 
overall exit markets have contracted, VC firms have become more selective with equity. This, paired 
with the expansion of private credit in general — venture and otherwise — has provided some 
startups the opportunity to push back new funding rounds given the economic and geopolitical 
uncertainties affecting the market. While the cost of venture debt can be high, it can be particularly 
attractive for startups that are at or close to profitability and believe they have the economics to 
handle the debt load and interest.
Fintechs positioning for exit — the question is when?
The US is home to numerous fintechs that are at the front of the line from a maturity perspective, 
which has made them good candidates to lead an IPO charge. During the quarter, Sweden-based 
Klarna made big moves towards a US-based listing, including forging a partnership with US-based 
OnePay to offer buy now, pay later offerings to Walmart customers5 and filing its intent to IPO on the 
NYSE with the SEC.6 However, following tariff announcements that sparked market volatility, Klarna 
put its IPO on pause, opting to wait for a more stable environment.

VC investment in the US increases slightly led by OpenAI megadeal, cont’d.
Alternative energy stays on the radar of US VC investors
Despite shifting government priorities, alternative energy solutions 
remained quite high on the radar of VC investors in the US during Q1’25, 
in addition to technologies focused on providing more efficient energy 
production or more efficient energy consumption. During the quarter, 
advanced nuclear energy developer X Energy raised close to
$700 million, while nuclear fusion-focused Helion raised $425 million. 
Growing recognition of the need to meet rapidly rising energy demands 
will likely continue to spur investment in the alternative energy space 
heading into Q2’25.
Secondaries market continues to play positive role in 
providing liquidity
Given the extended drought in the IPO market, secondaries have 
continued to fill a void in the US in terms of providing liquidity to 
employees and early investors. The perception of secondaries has shifted 
significantly over the last 18 months; historically secondaries have been 
heavily discounted, while more recent secondary transactions have seen 
discounts narrow. This may reflect a number of trends, including 
companies choosing to stay private and using secondaries to provide 
employee and investor liquidity opportunities.
Trends to watch for in Q2’25
Heading into Q2’25, geopolitical tensions and 
economic concerns could keep some VC 
investors holding back given the amount of 
uncertainty in the market, in part because of 
the potential need to provide additional 
financing to existing portfolio companies as 
they navigate uncertain economic, supply 
chain and exit conditions. Investment in AI will 
likely continue to be the brightest light in the 
US, with investments expanding to include a 
broad variety of solutions from small language 
models, robotics, and agentic AI to AI-driven 
solutions for industries such as defense tech, 
health and biotech, and others.
M&A activity will be a key area to watch, as 
some companies may pursue strategic exits 
through acquisitions in response to ongoing 
market uncertainty. Attention will also remain 
fixed on the stock markets and whether 
volatility subsides enough to restore 
confidence in the IPO pipeline.

“
The energy transition is 
happening — there’s no turning 
back. While the pace may vary, 
investors are shifting from 
speculative R&D to proven 
business models in areas like 
nuclear and next-gen power.
At the same time, there’s renewed 
interest in traditional oil and gas, 
not as a step backward, but as a 
necessary part of a balanced, 
more efficient energy mix. The 
hype has cooled, but serious 
investors see this moment as a 
real opportunity.”

“
Liquidity continues to be a priority 
for many investors in VC firms. 
This has led to a rapid rise in 
secondary transactions to meet 
the demand. Venture capitalists 
are also pushing for smaller exits 
through acquisitions rather than 
waiting for larger, long-term 
returns in older portfolios. 
Additionally, there's growing 
interest in continuity vehicles that 
allow VC funds to reset the 
investment timeline. This gives a 
fund's investors the option for 
immediate liquidity or the chance 
to stay in the portfolio for potential 
future gains, alongside new 
investors. Multiple firms are either 
implementing this strategy or 
considering it right now.”

“
Markets don’t like uncertainty, 
and the US administration is 
causing significant uncertainty 
with its new tariff policies. That 
reality, coupled with the fact that 
no one wants to be the first to 
ring the bell in case they fall flat, 
has put a bit of a drag on the IPO 
window. Unfortunately, several 
companies that had bravely 
declared their path to IPO like 
Klarna and StubHub, have had to 
pull back on their plans recently 
due to the uncertainty. Having 
said that, if things settle, I am 
cautiously upbeat about IPOs 
going forward.”

Americas sees VC investment rise, but deal volume continues decline
Venture capital investment in the Americas climbed to a 13-quarter high in Q1 2025, driven by a wave of megadeals in the large language model (LLM) space — though the total was 
significantly skewed by OpenAI’s $40 billion raise.
Despite the surge in deal value, deal volume declined for the fourth straight quarter, highlighting 
continued investor caution. The number of deals softened notably, as the region faced a rockier-
than-expected start to the year. While optimism had grown following the US presidential election, 
renewed uncertainty around potential US tariffs prompted many VC investors to reassess and scale 
back their activity.
Uncertainties rattle stock markets, driving many US IPO exits farther out 
Heading into Q1’25, there was positivity that with the lessening of uncertainty in the wake of the US 
election, IPO exits would begin to pick up after the extended dry spell. However, a fresh wave of 
uncertainty and related stock market turbulence driven by the announcement of various tariffs by the 
new US administration caused many IPO ready startups to push their US IPO exit plans out another
6-12 months. During Q1’25, US-based AI infrastructure company CoreWeave was the only large tech 
company to brave the uncertainty to hold an IPO. After downsizing its IPO, CoreWeave raised
$1.5 billion at a $23 billion valuation, ending flat at the end of its first day of trading.7
VC investment in Canada hits multi-year low
Venture capital investment in Canada was notably subdued in Q1 2025, amid escalating concerns over 
a tariff war with the United States. Total VC investment reached just $917 million across 148 deals — 
levels not seen since early 2018.
The muted activity was also likely influenced by the upcoming federal election in April, which caused 
many VC firms and corporate investors to hold off on major funding decisions. Among the largest 
Canadian deals of the quarter were a $53 million raise by LemFi, a financial services platform for 
immigrants, and a $50 million round by Clutch, an online automotive buy-and-sell platform.
In response to the burgeoning trade war with the US, Q1’25 saw the Business Development Bank of 
Canada announce $500 million in capital for its Growth Venture Fund and $450 million for its Growth 
Equity Partners funds in order to support Canadian growth-stage tech companies having difficulties 
raising funding given the difficult market conditions.8
VC investment in Mexico dries up in Q1’25 as trade concerns drive uncertainty
VC investment in Mexico fell quarter-over-quarter as trade tensions with the US caused uncertainty to 
rise to levels not seen in recent memory. Some VC investors held back from making investments in 
Mexico — and Latin America more broadly — while corporates with nearshoring plans and companies 
looking to potentially expand operations to Mexico also hit pause amid concerns and uncertainties 
related to announced and pending US tariffs. At a sector level, fintech continued to be the focus of VC 
investment in Mexico; during Q1’25, credit and BNPL company Plata raised $160 million — earning it 
coveted unicorn status with a valuation of $1.5 billion.9 Proptech has also seen some growth in 
Mexico, particularly related to short-term and vacation rentals.

Americas sees VC investment rise, but deal volume continues decline, cont’d.
Canada not being left behind in AI space
While the US accounted for the vast majority of VC investment in 
AI — not only in the Americas, but globally — Canada has continued 
to grow its AI ecosystem and leadership in key areas, including 
AI-driven data analytics and AI enablement in areas like customer 
relations. In Q1’25, the Canadian government launched its $300 
million AI Compute Access Fund to provide affordable assess to 
computing power for the development of AI solutions by Canadian 
small and mid-sized companies.10
Government of Mexico focused on building for the future
During Q1’25, Mexico released Plan México, a six-year economic 
development plan focused on building Mexico’s economy in a number 
of strategic ways — from creating jobs in specialized manufacturing 
and promoting environmentally sustainable investments to producing 
more goods in Mexico and providing access to finance to more small 
and mid-sized businesses.11 Looking forward, it is expected that this 
plan could spur activity in a range of sectors, including infrastructure, 
clean energy, and pharma and biotech.

11 https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/plan-mexico-world-10th-largest-economy-sheinbaum/
Trends to watch for in Q2’25
Across the Americas, uncertainty will likely be a 
big theme heading into Q2’25 given the ongoing 
trade tensions between the US and other 
jurisdictions, including Canada and Mexico.
IPO activity across the Americas is expected to 
remain relatively subdued in Q2, as investors 
stay cautious and wait for greater clarity on the 
economic outlook, stock market performance, 
and the evolving tariff agenda.
In the US, AI will likely continue to attract the 
largest share of VC investment. In Canada, 
there could be some additional consolidation 
among smaller startups in an effort to achieve 
scale. AI and cleantech will likely continue to 
attract interest from investors in Canada, 
although given the uncertain market, funding 
will likely remain muted over the next quarter. In 
Mexico, the fintech market could see some 
consolidation as the largest companies succeed 
and others look to consolidate in order to better 
compete or to keep from falling by the wayside. 
During the quarter, Mexico could also see 
investments moving forward related to Plan 
Mexico, particularly in areas like infrastructure, 
energy, and biotech and pharma.

“
In early 2025, we’re seeing 
steady exit activity in Canada 
driven by consolidation, while 
VC investment remains cautious 
amid uncertainty around tariffs 
and the upcoming federal 
election. Despite this, Canada is 
doubling down on AI with major 
government funding for compute 
infrastructure, and we're seeing 
early signs of growth in clean 
tech, fusion energy, and deep 
tech. The overarching theme 
right now is uncertainty — but 
targeted investments in AI and 
sustainability show long-term 
optimism.”

“
We are living in a completely 
uncertain environment — 
possibly the most uncertain we’ve 
ever faced. And that’s affecting 
all business and economic 
spaces — not just VC. It’s difficult 
to define the potential economic 
impact because there’s no 
certainty yet. But even with the 
uncertainty, some sectors will 
continue to attract funding, 
including fintech and proptech. 
Sectors like clean energy, 
infrastructure, and pharma could 
also start to see more interest 
given the government’s new 
economic plan.”

European VC investment holds steady, but deal volume falls
VC investment in Europe remained flat in Q1 2025, holding at $18 billion, the same as in Q4 2024. However, deal volume declined significantly, with 1,883 deals recorded — down from 
2,314 the previous quarter. 
Despite the overall plateau in funding value, the number of megadeals increased, signaling a shift 
towards larger, later-stage investments. Q1 2025 saw five deals exceeding $500 million, up from three 
in Q4 2024. On a country level, the UK led European investment activity with $5.5 billion raised, 
followed by Germany at $2.2 billion and France at $1.7 billion.
Q1’25 deal volume drops to nine-year low amid geopolitical and economic 
uncertainty
Despite expectations that deal volume might begin to show a true rebound in Q1’25, the number 
of VC deals in Europe fell to a nine-year low amid a fresh wave of geopolitical and economic 
uncertainty driven in part by concerns related to the new US administration’s announcement of various 
tariffs regimes.
AI space remains super hot as VC investors focus on industry applications
During Q1’25, VC investors in Europe continued to show significant interest in AI, although deal sizes 
were relatively subdued compared to previous quarters — partly due to the absence of big raises by 
LLM-focused companies. Startups focused on industry applications of AI saw the strongest interest in 
Q1’25, with companies in the health and biotech (Neko Health — $260 million, Cera — $150 million) 
and enterprise communications (Synthesia — $180 million) spaces raising large rounds. 
The European Commission showed very strong commitment to the evolution of AI in Q1’25 with the 
announcement of its $206 billion InvestAI program,12 including significant funding for the development 
of gigafactories. In Q1’25, France also announced $112 billion in committed AI investments, including 
€20 billion from Canada-based investment firm Brookfield for AI-focused projects in the country.13
Health and biotech sector attracts numerous $100 million+ VC deals 
VC investment in the health and biotech sector was robust in Q1’25, with numerous $100 million+ 
funding rounds across the region, including raises by UK-based Verdiva Bio ($410 million) and Cera 
($150 million); Sweden-based Neko Health ($260 million); Switzerland-based Windward Bio
($200 million), Numab ($194 million), CeQur Simplicity ($120 million), and Ireland-based Fire1 
($120 million). The diversity of investments across both geographies and focus areas (e.g. obesity 
therapeutics, oncology treatments, insulin delivery wearables, digital healthcare solutions, medical 
scanning) highlights the continued strength of investor interest in all areas of health and biotech, from 
health management and monitoring to medical devices, digital health, and disease prevention. 
VC investment in the UK falls quarter-over-quarter
VC investment in the UK fell between Q4’24 and Q1’25 as VC investors continued to show a 
preference for proven startups given the uncertain market conditions and the ongoing lack of exits. 
While the health and biotech sector continued to attract robust investment during Q1’24 — led by a
$410 million raise by Verdiva Bio — some UK-based biotech companies requiring patient capital 
struggled to attract funding as VC investors focused on startups with quicker paths to profitability.
M&A activity started to pick up in the UK during Q1’25, although the uptick has not yet translated into 
deal value given slow deal speeds and the enhanced focus on due diligence. During the quarter, PE 
firms were much more active in the M&A market, both due to improving interest rates and the desire to 
make investments within a reasonable timeframe or risk taking themselves out of existence.

European VC investment holds steady, but deal volume falls, cont’d.
Germany sees VC investment rise
Despite an increase in VC funding in Q1’25, the total number of VC 
deals in Germany was incredibly low compared to historical norms, with 
many completed deals coming as follow-on investments from existing 
investors. Seed and pre-seed deals were particularly soft, driven in part 
by a pullback from VCs looking to derisk their investments. The federal 
election in February likely also had a subduing effect on deal activity as 
investors waited to assess the impact of shifting government priorities on 
the VC ecosystem.
Despite uncertainties, fintech, AI and deeptech, and defense remained 
quite attractive to VC investors in Germany. Real estate decarbonization 
firm Reneo raised the largest funding round in Germany during the 
quarter ($624 million), followed distantly by medical education company 
Amboss ($257 million). During Q1’25, a growing number of late-stage 
companies in Germany also focused on IPO readiness programs, with 
the hope of exit opportunities towards the end of 2025 and into 2026.
Nordic region sees dip in VC funding in Q1’25
VC investment in the Nordic region fell quarter-over-quarter, although 
investors continued to show interest in areas like healthtech and 
cleantech. During the quarter, Sweden-based preventative health 
technology company Neko Health raised $260 million, sustainable 
energy services company Elvy raised $153 million, and Finland-based 
low carbon hydrogen producer Hycamite raised $45.8 million. Current 
geopolitical uncertainty, tariffs and trade tensions may prolong the 
stagnate state of the Nordic VC investment further down 2025.
VC investment in Ireland rises significantly on back of 
megadeals
Ireland experienced it’s strongest quarter of VC investment in several 
years in Q1’25, driven primarily by large megadeals, including a
$125 million raise by AI-powered productivity software company 
Tines, a $120 million raise by medical device company Fire1, and a 
$120 million raise by ocean data services company Xocean. Fintech 
and medtech sectors in Ireland continue to attract significant interest 
from VC investors given their robust innovation ecosystems and 
strong talent base, with AI solutions also receiving significant 
investment over the quarter. While positive coming into 2025, the 
sentiment of VC investors in Ireland was one of caution in the latter 
half of Q1’25 amid rising geopolitical uncertainties. The growing 
uncertainty could impact VC investment heading into 2025.
Global | US | Americas  Europe Asia
Trends to watch for in Q2’25
Heading into Q2’25, deal volume will likely 
remain subdued as investors in Europe 
remain very cautious amid trade tensions 
with the US. The implications associated 
with any US tariffs could be significant; 
both investors and startups are expected 
to be quite focused on assessing potential 
impacts on both general operations and 
potential cross-border expansion plans. 
Despite these uncertainties, areas like AI, 
defense tech, and cleantech will likely 
continue to attract significant megadeals 
in Europe.

“
While we’re still seeing funds being 
deployed and funds being raised, 
deal volume continues to be lower 
than expected. This tells us a few 
things. There’s clearly huge 
confidence in certain sectors.
AI, cleantech, fintech — they’re all 
still seeing megadeals. But what 
we’re not seeing is that higher 
cadence of Series A and Series B 
rounds come back. And maybe 
that’s a trend here to stay with 
investors writing bigger and longer 
lifecycle cheques — giving 3 years 
of runway rather than 18 months to 
hit certain milestones.”

“
We’re noticing that a lot of VC 
investors right now are looking for 
companies that are going to be 
relatively quick to profitability at 
the moment. In the UK, this has 
made it challenging for startups in 
IP-rich areas like biotech to attract 
sufficient funding. These kinds of 
companies require patient capital, 
which is not very favorable at the 
moment. It feels like a real shame 
given the innovative companies 
we have here in the UK and  
these IP-rich sectors are not 
getting the support that they 
might need. ”

“
Irish VC fundraising was very 
strong in Q1’25 led by significant 
fundraises by Tines, XOcean and 
Fire1. The lower deal count quarter 
on quarter is reflective of a more 
cautious sentiment given broader 
geopolitical uncertainty since the 
turn of the year. Notwithstanding 
these challenges, VC investment in 
Ireland mirrored international trends 
with robust interest in the AI, big 
data and medtech sectors.”

The big investments in Germany 
right now are coming later-stage 
fintechs, and from AI and 
deeptech companies. We’re also 
seeing interest in hardware 
startups focused on areas like 
chip development and some 
investment in drones and other 
defense-related startups. The 
focus on defense tech is a major 
change here in Germany — 
historically investors have been 
very shy about investing in the 
space. That’s definitely changing.”

defense and dual-use companies

“
Q1’25 investment trends are 
consistent with that of previous 
2024 quarters, with a gradual 
increase both in number and 
volume of deals. Over 60% of the 
deals are early stage (pre-seed to 
Round A), while later stage deals 
included five rounds of $100M or 
more. 20 M&A deals took place in 
Q1, with seven deals of $100M or 
more. We see a positive sentiment 
by leading foreign VCs, which 
established or strengthened their 
presence in Israel, banking on the 
current decline in companies’ 
valuations. We expect the positive 
trend to continue into Q2 2025, with 
certain reservations pertaining to 
unforeseen circumstances due to 
current global economic instability.”

Asia sees VC activity decline amid regional headwinds
Both venture capital investment and deal volume declined in Asia during Q1 2025, with the region raising just $12.9 billion across 2,149 deals — reflecting continued softness in the market. 
The downturn was largely driven by persistent challenges in China, including economic uncertainty and ongoing real estate sector issues, as well as heightened investor caution in India, 
amid broader geopolitical tensions. Singapore was the lone bright spot, bucking the regional trend thanks to a $1.2 billion raise by data center company DayOne, which significantly 
boosted the country’s quarterly totals.
AI space sees a lot of excitement in Asia during Q1’25, particularly in China
The AI space in Asia attracted a significant amount of attention in Q1’25, driven by the launch of China-based 
DeepSeek’s R1 model. This was seen as a major win for China’s AI sector, given the expectation that access 
to DeepSeek’s open source model will help a lot of AI application companies further advance their own 
models and AI-driven solutions. During the quarter, two Chinese tech giants also launched major AI 
offerings — including Tencent, which launched the T1 reasoning model,14 and Alibaba, which released the 
Qwen 2.5 artificial intelligence model. This feverish level of activity highlights the highly competitive nature of 
the space and the quest for dominant market position.15
IPO market in Hong Kong (SAR), China shows strength in Q1’25
The IPO market and stock exchanges in Hong Kong (SAR), China got off to a strong start in Q1’25. 
The HKSE hosted a number of IPOs, including Mixue — China’s largest bubble tea company — which 
saw shares rise 47 percent in first day trading.16 Given the degrading performance of the US stock 
exchanges over the quarter, there was a notable shift of Asia-based investors back to the HKSE, and 
growing interest from investors from Korea and Japan. The rise in transaction volume was particularly 
positive, prompting a sense of positivity heading into Q2’25. During Q1’25, Hong Kong also enhanced its
efforts to market the HKSE as a place for IPO fundraising within other jurisdictions, including Saudi 
Arabia and Japan.
Quiet quarter of VC investment in China amid absence of largest deals
VC investment in China was muted in Q1’25, both as a result of a natural slowdown in deal activity 
related to Chinese New Year, and because of ongoing economic challenges. Following on trends seen
 
in recent quarters, much of the VC investment in China during Q1’25 occurred in areas considered to be 
major government priorities, including hard technologies, new energy, electric vehicles, and AI. 
Cleantech company SE Environmental raised the largest deal in China during the quarter ($688 million) 
followed by new energy vehicle company Changan Kaicheng ($274 million), AI-powered autonomous 
van company Neolix Technologies ($137 million), electronic design automation company Univista 
($137 million), and chip manufacturer InventChip Technology ($136 million). 
VC investors in China also continued to show interest in earlier-stage companies, evidenced by the 
popularity of pre-Series A deals during the quarter. Tis likely reflects a desire to invest in companies 
early in order to leverage the growth when their technologies are ready to be monetized in the market. 
VC investment dips slightly in India as investors taking a wait-and-see approach to 
uncertainty
India saw VC investment drop slightly in Q1’25 as investors held back from making major investments 
given the rapidly evolving geopolitical situation. Capital markets also took a beating in India during the 
quarter amid concerns of overpricing. While markets recovered somewhat in the second half of Q1’25, 
the general trajectory was lower than initially expected in Q4’24. 
E-commerce and quick commerce big winners in India in Q1’25
VC investors in India remained highly focused on consumer offerings in Q1’25, with areas such as
e-commerce and quick commerce attracting the most significant attention; during the quarter social
e-commerce platform Meesho raised $550 million. Payments and lending also continued to be a key
sector of investment in India, with Tonetag — a startup focused on voice-powered commerce and
payments — raising $78 million.

Asia sees VC activity decline amid regional headwinds, cont’d.
Japan’s VC market holds relatively steady amid regional 
declines
VC investment in Japan remained relatively strong in Q1 2025, reaching 
$902 million across 290 deals, compared to $1.1 billion on 318 deals in Q4 
2024. In the context of broader declines across Asia, Japan’s performance 
was notably stable. That said, the market faced headwinds, including 
ongoing softness in IPO activity, which limited perceived exit opportunities 
and dampened expectations for VC fund performance.  Additionally, a 
growing number of startups struggled to secure follow-on funding during 
the quarter — a trend that may lead to increased sales or dissolutions 
heading into Q2 2025.
Government support for spacetech development in Japan
In Japan, AI, DeepTech and SpaceTech attracted the most attention from 
VC investors in Q1’25, in addition to drug discovery, ESG-related solutions, 
and SaaS IT solutions. Spacetech was particularly notable given the $51 
million raise by microsatellite company ArkEdge Space and the $44 million 
raise by space transportation and satellite development company 
Interstellar Technologies. Government support for the space satellite 
sector, the ready availability of rocket launch locations in the country, and 
the expectation that Japan will increase its space-related defense budget 
will likely keep SpaceTech a hot area of innovation and investment heading 
into Q2’25.
Biotech seeing increasing interest in China as investors 
eye licensing-out opportunities
Historically, VC investors in China have been hesitant about investing 
in biotech because of the long timeframe required for returns. This 
trend shifted in Q1’25, in part because of the growth in licensing-out 
trends, which have led to developments in different regions and 
attracted fresh cash flows to China-based biotechs. During the quarter, 
VC investors showed increasing interest in biotechs with the potential 
to license out their pipelines. 
Global | US | Americas | Europe Asia
Trends to watch for in Q2’25
Heading into Q2’25, VC investment in Asia is 
expected to remain subdued, particularly 
giving geopolitical uncertainties. If China’s 
central government moves to support the 
development of the private sector, it could 
spark improved confidence among VC 
investors and potentially drive an uptick in 
investment in China. VC investment in India 
could remain somewhat soft in Q2’25, 
although the long-term outlook remains 
positive given the country’s strong macros. 
In Japan, corporate investment will be one 
area to watch in Q2’25, both in terms of 
direct VC investment and M&A activity.

“
The most important thing in India 
right now is that the macros are 
intact. Nothing fundamentally has 
changed. The money has started 
coming back to India. There are 
certain large IPOs of startups that 
have been announced, which 
should hit the market over the 
next one or two quarters. I think 
we are back in business — and 
what we’re seeing now is really 
just a minor impediment — a 
speedbump.”

“
Everything that has happened in 
the AI space here in China this 
quarter — in terms of the launch 
of DeepSeek, Tencent, and 
Alibaba’s different AI models — 
gives me a lot of confidence in 
this sector and the investment 
possibilities that will occur over 
time. These advancements will 
not only spur the development of 
other AI offerings, but the more 
players that there are, the more 
healthy competition there will be 
in the market.”

“
Venture capital flows to Australian 
startups remained steady during 
the first quarter of the year. Global 
economic uncertainty may tamper 
some of the cautious optimism we 
saw at the start of 2025, but we 
are still seeing investor interest in 
AI and greentech innovation as 
well as an uptick of activity in 
sectors such as defence and 
space.”

“
Corporates here in Japan have 
continued to show a good appetite 
for VC investment, although we are 
seeing some narrow their focus — 
supporting companies with 
synergies to their own business 
strategy rather than investing more 
broadly, likely with future M&A or 
business alliances in mind.”

About the report
Methodology
KPMG uses PitchBook as the provider of venture data for the Venture Pulse report 
Please note that the MESA and Africa regions are NOT broken out in this report. Accordingly, if you add up the Americas, 
Asia-Pacific and Europe regional totals, they will not match the global total, as the global total considers those other regions. 
Those specific regions were not highlighted in this report due to a paucity of datasets and verifiable trends.
In addition, particularly within the European region, the Venture Pulse does not contain any transactions that are tracked as 
private equity growth by PitchBook. As such rounds are often conflated with late-stage venture capital in media coverage, there 
can be confusion regarding specific rounds of financing. The key difference is that PitchBook defines a PE growth round as a 
financial investment occurring when a PE investor acquires a minority stake in a privately held corporation. Thus, if the investor is 
classified as PE by PitchBook, and it is the sole participant in the recipient company’s financing, then such a round will usually be 
classified as PE growth, and not included in the Venture Pulse datasets. However, as of the Q4 2022 edition, a new stage for 
venture that was invented by PitchBook to account for growth at late-stage VC will be included, defined as venture growth. That 
same edition saw some minor updates to the wording of the methodology on this page.
Also, if a company is tagged with any PitchBook vertical, excepting manufacturing and infrastructure, it is kept. Otherwise, the 
following industries are excluded from growth equity financing calculations: buildings and property, thrifts and mortgage finance, 
real estate investment trusts, and oil & gas equipment, utilities, exploration, production and refining. Lastly, the company in 
question must not have had an M&A event, buyout, or IPO completed prior to the round in question.
Fundraising
PitchBook defines VC funds as pools of capital raised for the purpose of investing in the equity of startup companies. In 
addition to funds raised by traditional VC firms, PitchBook also includes funds raised by any institution with the primary 
intent stated above. Funds identifying as growthstage vehicles are classified as PE funds and are not included in this 
report. A fund’s location is determined by the country in which the fund’s investment team is based; if that information is 
not explicitly known, the HQ country of the fund’s general partner is used. Only funds based in the United States that have 
held their final close are included in the fundraising numbers. The entirety of a fund’s committed capital is attributed to the 
year of the final close of the fund. Interim close amounts are not recorded in the year of the interim close.
Deals
PitchBook includes equity investments into startup companies from an outside source. Investment does not necessarily 
have to be taken from an institutional investor. This can include investment from individual angel investors, angel groups, 
seed funds, VC firms, corporate venture firms, corporate investors, and institutions, among others. Investments received 
as part of an accelerator program are not included; however, if the accelerator continues to invest in follow-on rounds, 
those further financings are included. All financings are of companies headquartered in the US, with any reference to 
“ecosystem” defined as the combined statistical area (CSA). PitchBook includes deals that include partial debt and equity.
Pre-seed/seed: The pre-seed stage encompasses a collection of emergent startups receiving the first check from at least 
one institutional investor to fuel their development growth. For global startups, we reclassify angel deals depending on 
institutional investors’ prior deal participation. Deals that have been tagged as “angel” due to the company’s investor base
consisting solely of individual investors will now be recategorized into the early-stage or late-stage VC deal category 
based on stage methodologies in place. For startups headquartered in the US and Europe, we define pre-seed as a 
round of financing for a company founded less than two years ago that has not yet received institutional investor 
support. This update was made in the Q4 2023 edition of Venture Pulse and all subsequent editions.
•
Early-stage: Rounds are generally classified as Series A or B (which we typically aggregate together as early-stage) 
either by the series of stock issued in the financing or, if that information is unavailable, by a series of factors 
including: the age of the company, prior financing history, company status, participating investors, and more. 
•
Late-stage: Rounds are generally classified as Series C or D or later (which we typically aggregate together as 
late-stage) either by the series of stock issued in the financing or, if that information is unavailable, by a series of 
factors including: the age of the company, prior financing history, company status, participating investors, and more. 
•
Growth: Financings tagged as Series E or later or deals involving companies that are at least seven years old and 
have raised at least six VC rounds will be included in this category, as of the Q4 2022 edition of Venture Pulse 
released in January 2023.
•
Corporate: Corporate rounds of funding for currently venture-backed startups that meet the criteria for other 
PitchBook venture financings are included in the Venture Pulse as of March 2019.
•
Corporate venture capital: Financings classified as corporate venture capital include rounds that saw both firms 
investing via established CVC arms or corporations making equity investments off balance sheets or whatever other 
non-CVC method is employed.
Exits
PitchBook includes the first majority liquidity event for holders of equity securities of venture-backed companies. This 
includes events where there is a public market for the shares (IPO) or the acquisition of majority of the equity by another 
entity (corporate or financial acquisition). This does not include secondary sales, further sales after the initial liquidity 
event, or bankruptcies. M&A value is based on reported or disclosed figures, with no estimation used to assess the value 
of transactions for which the actual deal size is unknown. IPO value is based on the premoney valuation of the company 
at its IPO price. One slight methodology update is the categorical change from “IPO” to “public listings” to accommodate 
the different ways we track VC-backed companies’ transitions to the public markets. To give readers a fuller picture of 
the companies that go public, this updated grouping includes IPOs, direct listings, and reverse mergers via special 
purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). 
In the edition of the KPMG Venture Pulse covering Q1 2019 and all ensuing, PitchBook’s methodology regarding aggregate 
exit values changed. Instead of utilizing the size of an IPO as the exit value, the prevaluation of an IPO, based upon 
ordinary shares outstanding, was utilized. This has led to a significant change in aggregate exit values in all subsequent 
editions yet is more reflective of how the industry views the true size of an exit via public markets. In the edition of the 
KPMG Venture Pulse covering Q1 2021 and all ensuing, the IPO exit type was updated to include all types of public listings, 
including SPACs and other reverse mergers. In January 2025, a new extrapolation for M&A exit values was also applied.
